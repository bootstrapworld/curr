This is the repository for Bootstrap curriculum and the software
infrastructure that generates notes, handouts, workbooks, and other
educational materials from the curriculum.

# Installation

1.  You'll need to install [DrRacket v6.10 or later](http://www.racket-lang.org "DrRacket v6.10 or later") 
and [wkhtmltopdf, version 0.12.3](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/releases/0.12.3/ "wkhtmltopdf, version 0.12.3") first, before cloning the `curr`
repository. (Note: the current release of wkhtmltopdf, version 0.12.4 as of this writing, contains a regression that prevents the workbook from printing properly)

2.  Then set up `curr` as a Racket collection.

    Go to the parent directory of `curr`, and do the following:

    `$ raco link curr`


3.  Generate the curriculum.

    `$ ./build-distrib`

By default, this will build every course in every available language in the `/distribution` directory. Note: this can take some time!

If you wish to build only the lesson plans (not the workbook and solutions), you can also use `$ ./build-notes`. Similarly, `$ ./build-workbook` will create the workbook without also building the lesson plans. 

All three of these scripts accept the following arguments: `--language [en-us|es-mx|etc]` and `--course [algebra|reactive|data-science|physics]`
