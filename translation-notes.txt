TO TRANSLATE A SINGLE BOOTSTRAP UNIT PAGE

source: curr/courses/algebra/units/*/the-unit.scrbl

* the @ sign marks a scribble command. So @student names a formatting
  function in our scribble infrastructure. You are looking to edit the
  arguments to those functions, but not the @names themselves.

* Editing the arguments to the @functions will update both the
  activities in the notes and the teachers notes

In particular, you are looking to edit

- the @title contents at the top of the file
- the argument to @unit-descr near the top of the file 
- for each @lesson/studteach,
   - the string tagged as #:title
   - the #:duration content
   - any text in the other tags in the header
- the text within each @student and @teacher block

-------

The metadata at the top of each unit page comes from several source
files:

* curr/lib/glossary-terms.rkt
  this maps vocabulary terms (tagged with @vocab) to definitions.
  This file is consulted to generate the glossary at the top of each
  unit page, based on the @vocab terms that appear on the page.

* curr/lib/standards.csv
  this file maps learning standards tags to their descriptions. It is
  used to generate the standards section at the top of each unit
  page.

  IGNORE the file lib/standards-dictionary.rkt.  That is an unused
  file that I need to get around to taking out of the repo.

-----

The file that defines all of the scribble formatting commands is

   curr/lib/form-elements.rkt

There are little bits of English text within this file. This file also
has some dead code in it.

Not all string constants get translated.  In particular, if you see a
string immediately after #:style, do not translate it.  That string is
naming a css tag that our css files depend on.

Here are the spots I could readily spot that will need updating.  We
will find the rest as we generate the pages and detect stray English
words:

* the language-table function ("Types" and "Functions") [line 274]

* in the lesson/studteach function [line 516]

    - the string arguments to the lesson-section commands in the middle
      of the function ("Learning Objectives", etc) [line 568+]
    - the capitalized "Overview" [line 566]
    - the capitalized "Time" [line 590]

* the word "Agenda" in the agenda function [line 375]

* the word "Glossary" in gen-glossary [line 431, NOT line 428]za

* the button names (in the "value" argument) in the
  insert-teacher-toggle-button function [line 682]

* in unit-overview/auto [line 849]
      - "Unit Overview" [line 864]
      - "Product Outcomes" [line 879]
      - "Materials" [line 885]
      - "Preparation" [line 889]

* in learn-evid-from-standards [line 635]
      - "Standards and Evidence Statements" [line 666]
      - "Standards Document"  [line 671]

---------------

In the lower part of the file, there are additional strings around our
generated exercise handouts.  We will need to translate those in the
second phase, after we get the units to translate properly.  I'll
update this document around exercise generation when we get to that
point.
