;; Create a design-recipe exercise
;;   funname: string naming the function
;;   directions: instructions for the problem 
;; num-examples says how many examples to generate.  Some of the examples may be specified
;;   by populating the example-list and configuring show-examples (keep reading)
;; example-list is a list of lists giving the input and output: e.g., (list (list 5 '(* 5 2)))
;;   the list contents can be num/string/sexp -- anything that format can convert to a string
;;   - for Pyret, answers are intentionally generated with #:fmt-quotes #f,
;;     so be sure to format your examples with args of any kind, then a single string as the
;;     answer. The above example would be (list (list 5 "5 * 2"))
;; answer: ie 
;; show-examples is a list of configurations of which parts of each elt in example-list to show
;;    - each configuration is either a boolean or a list of three booleans
;;    - e.g., show-examples of (list #f (list #t #f #t) #t) says
;;      * don't show any components of the first example in example-list
;;      * show the function name and output of the second example in example-list
;;      * show all components of the third example in example-list
;;    - show-examples cannot be longer than example-list  
;;    - if show-examples is shorter than example-list, remaining elts in example-list get configuration #f
;; if num-examples is larger than length of example-list, additional blank exercises are added after the
;;   contents of example-list
;; buggy-funname-defn and buggy-examples-list enable creating design-recipe worksheets with
;;   errors in them (for use as assessments).  By default, the funname argument is copied into the 
;;   header and into each example.  These params override that behavior.  At most one of the 
;;   example-list and the buggy-example-list should be provided.
