;; Parameters for controlling the distribution directories.  The top-level build.rkt
;;  must set these parameters
;; - root-deployment-dir: the root directory for files meant for deployment
;; - current-deployment-dir: the directory into which files for deployment are currently generated
;;   (should always be a subdir of root-deployment-dir) 
;; - deploy-resources-dir: directory built from root-deployment-dir where resources will be stored
;; - unit-to-resources-path: used in resource-link to generate relative paths from a the-unit.html
;;   file to the resources folder on a web installation.  Cannot use deploy-resources-dir for this
;;   because we may copy a subdirectory of the generated distribution to a site (such as copying 
;;   just the algebra/units directory over to code.org)
