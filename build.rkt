;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Command-line Usage Guideline ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;
;;; General Usage
; To run build with command-lines arguments, run "./build-notes --course <course> --language <lang>".
; You can run build using multiple tags. Each argument can only have one <value> follow it, BUT
; some of our command-line arguments need to be able to take multiple <values>. To fix this,
; enter your arguments seperated by underscores. Example:
;
;     ./build-notes --course algebra_reactive_physics
;
; The above command would build the algebra, reactive, and physics courses
;
;
;
;
;
;
;;; Different command-line tags and how to use them:
;;NOTE: These first four were added in Summer 2017 by Kielan Donahue and Jacob Jackson
;
; --course
; This selects which courses are to be produced. Can take multiple arguments (seperated by underscores)
;
; --language
; Not to be confused with "--lang", this selects what human languages to print documents in (currently only en-us or es-mx)
; This can take multiple arguments seperated by underscores.
;
; --sw or --suppress-warnings
; Denotes which types of WARNINGs are to be ignored while running build. Can be useful for WARNINGs that we expect
; and don't care about like evidence statements. In "lib/warnings.rkt" there is a list of all WARNING types. If the
; names are unclear, search for where that tag is used in the repo; almost all are from "lib/form-elements.rkt".
; NOTE: --sw can take multiple arguments, seperated by underscores. It can ALSO take "--sw all" to suppress all WARNINGs.
;;
;
; --deploy
; This indicates the directory to which to deploy the output
;
; --lang
; Indicate which language (Racket or Pyret) to generate
;
; --pdf
; Indicates the build to generate PDF documentation
;
;;
