Stage I - Directory Modifications

      1.   main.scrbl
In the course folder, create a "langs" directory
In this "langs" directory, create a folder for each language to which this course will be translated
In each of these language folders, put the version of "main.scrbl" for that language.
Example: To create the English structure in Algebra, create “/algebra/langs/en-us/main.scrbl

      2.   Teachers and workbook 
Create in the resources these structures for the appropriate module, putting en-us in for language unless you are translating
	/courses/<module>/resources/teachers/langs/<language>
		Into this file put all of the contents of the old file /teachers except 
-----
teachers-guide
WorkshopSlides.ppt
-----
		Leave these in courses/<module>/resources/teachers so that it contains 
-----
langs
teachers-guide
WorkshopSlides.ppt
-----
	/courses/<module>/resources/workbook/langs/<language>
Into this file put all of the contents of the old file /workbook. 
 
      3.   units 
In the course folder, go to the “units” directory, and create a “langs” directory within that.
In this "langs" directory, create a folder for each language to which this course will be translated
Move all contents of “/courses/<module>/units” to “courses/<module>/units/langs/<language>”.
	





Stage II - Reference modifications
 
main.scrbl
In the main.scrbl file for that course, in about the 5th line, there will be something like:
@boxed-text{@animated-gif{splash.png}Bootstrap:Algebra (or "Bootstrap:1") ...
Change the argument of “@animated-gif” to “../../splash.pgn”.
All that’s happening here is that the main.scrbl file now needs to move up out of langs/<language> to find the splash.png file.
 





Stage III - Add to course list
 
In build.rkt, there is a definition statement for “course-list” that states which courses are being constructed. 
Simply add to this list the name of whatever course it is that you are now building
