		<h1>Standards Alignment</h1>
      <p>Extra lessons are nice, but Math teachers don't <i>have</i> 25 hours of spare classtime to spend on new materials, no matter how good it might be.

      <p>That's why Bootstrap is aligned to National and State Standards for Mathematics, covering most Functional and Algebraic standards from Grade 7 through Algebra 2. This alignment makes it possible to integrate Bootstrap into the classroom smoothly, using time you've already planned into your pacing guidelines or scope and sequence plans.
      
      <p>For states using the Common Core, Bootstrap is also a model implementation of Common Core Standards for Mathematical Practice, offering explicit pedgagogical recommendation across all eight practice standards.

      <p>Bootstrap also satisfies several of the CSTA (Computer Science Teacher's Association) standards across levels 1 (grades K-6), 2 (grades 6-9), and 3 (grades 9-12); Bootstrap1 (the algebra-oriented first course) covers standards in levels 1 and 2, while Bootstrap2 goes deeper into computer science and covers more standards in levels 2 and 3.

            Bootstrap students are confronted with challenging problems, and use a problem-solving methodology known as the <i>Design Recipe</i> to solve them. The recipe teaches critical thinking, asking students to write down what they know and think through each step on their way to a solution.

            Teachers engage students in discussion about each step in the Design Recipe, asking them to explain how they move from one step to another. In addition, students are challenged to debug the code of others, not just by identifying programmatic flaws but by also identifying faulty reasoning.

          <td>
            When Bootstrap students want their characters to move, to stay onscreen or collide with one another, they must first model that behavior mathematically. And since the programming language is purely algebraic, these models become the programs themselves!

            Communicating precisely is key, whether you're a mathematician or a professional progammer. In Bootstrap, students consider datatypes, select clear function and variable names, and write comments for their code.

            Bootstrap students look closely at worked-out examples before generalizing to a formula, as part of the Design Recipe. When working with the Circles of Evaluation, students consider the structure of arithmetic expressions as functions being composed on one another -- and this structure becomes the basis for their code.

            By practicing the Design Recipe repeatedly, students begin to discern the connection between multiple representations of functions. They notice patterns in the examples they write and contracts they derive.

            Bootstrap's focus on abstraction works hand in hand with the concept of modularity. Students decompose complex problems into smaller ones, and build abstractions (functions, data structures, etc) to solve them. The abstractions are used to organize code, and can be composed with one another or repurposed to solve more complex problems without having to duplicate code. Students assemble these abstractions to form complex, reactive programs - relying on the modularity of those abstractions to manage complexity.

            Our pedagogy is based on a robust process for program development, known as the <i>Design Recipe</i>. This approach has been used for decades at the university level, and mirrors many best practices from industrial contexts. The Design Recipe is an iterative process that involves defining type specifications, communicating those specifications through writing, building example-driven test cases, implementation, and testing.
