We've listed the breakdown of concepts in the table below, so you can find the best fit for your class.Students learn how the world-based event loop that drives their Bootstrap:Algebra game works, and use it to create animations using simple datatypes for their world. They then learn about data structures, and design a World structure for a sophisticated game of their own design.

                        What makes your favorite athlete the Greatest of All Time?  How would you determine the most successful musician ever?  How is the population of your country changing?  Answering these questions involves collecting and manipulating data, from sports stats to record sales to census data.  Our <a href="courses/data-science">Data Science</a> module teaches students to view programs as questions we ask of data.  Students form their own questions about the world around them, and learn how to analyze data critically and carefully to find answers.  Business, science, and history teachers can utilize this module to help students make inferences from data.  Math teachers can use this module to introduce foundational concepts in statistics.  It also works great as a module for AP CS Principles' unit on data!

                        Our <a href="courses/physics/english">Physics</a> module helps students understand basic physics concepts by incorporating computer programming as one of the key tools for building models of the physical world. Targeted to ninth grade, during which every student is expected to take science, this initiative is designed to spark students’ interest in subjects related to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) for the rest of their academic careers. This initiative also combats a root cause of inequality of opportunity in pursuing STEM careers: disparate access to quality teaching in middle and high school. The module is aligned to the <a href="https://www.aapt.org/Resources/physicsfirst.cfm">Physics First</a> course, allowing teachers to easily embed computational modeling in their physics classes.

Hundreds of Bootstrap teachers across the globe are part of our discussion forum, and provide thoughtul answers about content, pedagogy and curriculum. Teachers can also search the forum for similar questions, and learn from previous conversations. Our own staff monitors the forum 24x7, and we guarantee a response with 24 hours.

                <h1>Software</h1> Bootstrap uses <a href="http://www.wescheme.org">WeScheme</a> and <a href="http://code.pyret.org">Pyret</a>, cloud-based IDEs that require <b>no downloading or installation</b>. Anyone with a Gmail account can start coding, storing and retrieving files from the cloud. Bootstrap programs can be shared simply by sending out a link, or posting it to sites such as Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, etc.
                <p/> No internet access? Bootstrap also supports <a href="http://www.drracket.org/">DrRacket</a>, a multi-platform graphical environment. DrRacket runs on all major platforms (Windows, OS X, Unix/Linux) and programs written for one platform run seamlessly on the others, supporting a wide variety of classroom and home computing scenarios. Its emphasis on beginner-friendly features and support for images makes it ideal for Bootstrap.
                <p/>
