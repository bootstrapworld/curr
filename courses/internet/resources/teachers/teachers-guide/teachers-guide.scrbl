@lesson/studteach[#:title "Running the Game"]{
@itemlist/splicing[@item{Near the end of the game file, you'll see an expression that defines a level, @code{(define game_level ...)}, passing in animation functions and images. You can define other levels if you wish, with different images or animation functions.}

You can stop this by adding a semicolon at the beginning of the line: @code{; (play game_level)}. This can make it easier for student to experiment with their code and test cases while they're developing, and they can always run the program manually by typing @code{(play game_level)} in the Interactions window.}]}


@lesson/studteach[#:title "Making Characters Move"]{
@itemlist/splicing[@item{Every Bootstrap game includes at least three "characters": the @code{Player}, the @code{Target} and the @code{Danger}.}
                   @item{Each is controlled by an @code{update-} function (e.g. @code{update-player}, @code{update-target}, etc.), named for the character it updates. These updates are like the pages of a flip-book: given a page, the update function generates the next logical page in the book.}
                   @item{These functions take the current coordinate as input, and return the next coordinate. If the @code{Target} moves to the left by 20 pixels each frame, then the body of the function should return @code{(- x 20)}.}
                   @item{You'll note that there is also a function called @code{update-mystery}. This function is actually for animating projectiles, if students insist on having them! (In the curriculum, this is kept a secret early on in order to encourage students to think beyond violent games.}
                   @item{The @code{update-player} function is slightly different from the rest:
                         @itemlist[@item{It takes two inputs: the y-coordinate of the player (a number) and the key that was pressed (a string, such as "h", "left" or "q").}

                   @item{If you'd like the player to move differently depending on which key is pressed, you'll need to use @code{cond}. For example:
                                                    
                        @code[#:multi-line #t]{; update-player : Number String -> Number

@lesson/studteach[#:title "Changing Your Game Images"]{
@itemlist/splicing[@item{Open the Game Template (either the WeScheme or DrRacket file). Towards the top of the program, you'll see some values defined for the @code{BACKGROUND}, @code{PLAYER}, @code{DANGER} and @code{TARGET}.}

                   @item{Make sure that PLAYER, TARGET, and DANGER images are at least 100x100, and BACKGROUND images are at least 640x480. A background that is too small will look stretched out.}

                   @item{Make sure that character images have transparent backgrounds. You may want to resize them to ensure that the background is at least 640x480, and that the characters are at least 100x100.}
                   @item{When you are done editing the images, you'll want to save and add them to your games. If you are using a program on your computer to the files, save them into the same folder as your student games. If you are using an online editor like pixlr.com, you can save the file directly to an image-sharing site like @(hyperlink "http://imgur.com" "imgur.com"), or upload it to other sites like Flickr, Dropbox, etc. Wherever you choose to save it on the web, be sure to remember the address for your new image!}

                   @item{By default, the function returns true - meaning that the characters are always considered onscreen. Once they get moving, they fly off the screen, never to return!}
                   @item{The "onscreen" logic should also take into account that the characters have width and height! For example, a 200px-wide character will still be partially onscreen even when it's x-coordinate is -50. For this reason, we recommend a "buffer" of roughly 50 pixels on all sides.}
                   @item{In the lesson plans, students write functions that check the left and right sides of the screen separately:

                    @item{Then they write a single function, called @code{onscreen?}, which is only true if their characters are protected on the left AND the right:

@lesson/studteach[#:title "Detecting Collisions"]{
@itemlist/splicing[@item{To detect whether or not two characters have collided, the game code needs to know two things: how close they are, and how close they are allowed to be before a "collision" occurs.}
                   @item{You can illustrate this by using the *@code{distances-color}* variable. Setting it to any color will draw triangles to show the distance between the @code{player}, @code{target} and @code{danger}. Setting the value to the empty string @code{""} will hide them again.}
                   @item{The lengths of each the legs is calculated by the @code{line-length} function. Modify the body so that it correctly calculates the distance between @code{a} and @code{b}.

                   @item{Finally, collide? starts out always returning false, so nothing collides even when you have the distances all working. Use the distance formula, with some threshold:
