The Domain for @code{star}, for example, specifies that the function needs a Number and two Strings, but doesn't mention the fact that the first String must be @code{"solid"} or @code{"outline"}. To add this information, programmers write @vocab{Purpose Statements}, which are simple sentences that explain what a function does.

The Purpose Statement goes further, telling you that the input is multiplied by 7. We can use this to write two examples, with different numbers of seconds as inputs.
