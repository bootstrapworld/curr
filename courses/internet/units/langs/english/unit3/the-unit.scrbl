                                             The first step in defining a function is to write its @vocab{Contract}.  Contracts summarize three pieces 
                                             of essential information about a function:
                                              @itemlist[@item{The @vocab{Name} of the function: in this case, the name is given, as @code{gt}}

                                                         @item{The @vocab{Range} of this function, which is the type of data that the function produces: in this case an Image since it produces solid, green triangles}]
                                              Here's the @code{gt} Contract written as code.  The line starts with a semicolon, followed by the name, a colon, the Domain, an arrow, then the Range:
                                              @code[#:multi-line ""]{; gt : Number -> Image}

                                    @teacher{It is often a good idea to give students examples of different word problems, and have them pick out the

                                             sees a semicolon, it ignores the rest of the line after the semicolon.  This means that you will never get an 
                                             error message from Racket for a malformed comment.  That also means that you have to check your students'

                                             These examples tell the computer that writing @code{(gt 50)} should produce the same result as
                                             @code{(triangle 50 "solid" "green")}, and that @code{(gt 100)} is equivalent to 
                                             @code{(triangle 100 "solid" "green")}. The word problem specifies that the examples @italic{must}
