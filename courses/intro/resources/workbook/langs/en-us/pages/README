The scrbl files in this directory are used to generate pages in the
workbook.  

For design-recipe exercises, the scribble files specify two broad
classes of details: the full solution to the exercise, and an
indication of which parts to reveal in the student version of the
workbook (the latter are in the *show* parameters).  If you create a
new exercise, please populate all parts of the solution (because we
will be generate the solution manual from these as well as the student
workbook).

Summary of the design-recipe parameters and their types follows.
After each param name, you'll see a (name val) pair -- the val is the
default value if you don't specify the given parameter.  Looking at
existing scrbl files should also be helpful.
