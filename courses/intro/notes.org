- Each rubric for an assignment is descriptive of the specific task used to demonstrate the skill or sub-skill. 
- The rubric for the skill is a meta rubric that groups the rubric parts. Each assignment has the same structure, but addresses a different aspect, modality, or complexity of the skill. When combined these rubrics amount to a summarization of the course expressed through the language of skills and criteria.

- How do I add section information to transmit to table of contents. This has to be during traverse.

- Add collector for lesson points. Add time to points. Lessons should accumulate the time of their points.
