Assignments use the following convention. Learn how to read the
assignment convention in order to connect your mastery feedback with
the relevant learning activities and tasks.

   @item{an assessment level (each assignment should only have one
    assessment level multiple choice items can demonstrate levels of
    mastery. However multiple choice item correctness has an element
    of chance. MC items are also difficult to protect from cheating or
    copying. Assessing with validity using multiple choice ites
    requires multiple questions assessing the same skil at the same
    level (at least 2?))}
   @item{a title}

   @item{ a criterion}
   @item{ a weight}]
@item{It is difficult to measure a single task as being accomplished to a
  degree like many rubrics describe. This may be the case with
  performance tasks and labs, where an open ended prompt is elaborated
  by a rubric that is tied to evaluation criteria. Items more
  generally take place in a context and demand a certain level of
  skill and knowledge transfer, which means that each item can
  generally be tagged with both a skill, a knowledge component and a
  criterion level indicating its depth of knowledge.}
