@title{Course Policies}

@section[#:style 'hidden]{Deadlines}
Assignments have deadlines. We respect that everyone needs to be able to manage their time. Work required within a deadline ensures that you will receive timely feedback on you learning in time for you to reflect and improve over the year that we are together.

We also respect that learning plants seeds that might not bear fruit for many years. High school is a challenging time period, and it is compulsory, meaning you might not have chosen everything your asked to do. That lack of freedom is something that even adults have to deal with. We have found that attending to the details even when it wasn't what you chose to do can earn you the freedom to pursue independent study, internships, and earn the trust of your community.

@section{Norms}
@section{Academic Habits}
@section{Culture }
The way we act and treat others is an expression of culture. People forms groups and naturally create normal way of behaving, which supports the goals of the group.
@section{Classrooms}
The nature of the classroom imposes certain cultural norms that govern how we act in the
classroom. Very practical demands own a large share. We are a large
group in a relatively small space. Think of riding on the subway. How much you can move, how loudly you speak are norms set by
the culture of that environment. Working together in classrooms will
demand that we recognize its cultural demands.
@section{Speaking}
Our classroom culture has demands on our speaking. Our voices are
powerful tools for communication. By speaking to others we activate
their eardrums by creating vibrations in the air with our vocal
chords. Our voices are unique in how they sound and in what we choose
to say. We can honor the power of our voice by asking what it means to have voice.
@section{Our space}
Each of us sharing this classroom space have a right to a piece that
we own for the time we are here. In this space I can store my belonginings without worrying about them. I can know that the
group respects that this space is mine. I have the right to focus and produce in that space.
@section{Learning}
The act of learning, deliberate learning, defines our culture. Coming
together to prepare young people for the challenges and demands of
adulthood is our primary purpose. Toward that goal we put the needs of
learning first. To learn you must feel safe, you must have mental
clarity, physical well-being (it's hard to learn when your hungry),
focus, motivation, and prior knowledge. Learning is fragile and
demands our full attention and committement if it is to succeed.
@subsection[#:style 'toc]{The Golden Rule}
All of our personal needs are also shared responsibilities for the
needs of others. Each member of our community has the same rights to
space, safety, and focus as every other. 
@section{The teacher}
The teacher strives to foster a culture of learning in which each
member of the community holds a place as valuable, visible,
honored. The teacher attempts this facilitation as a way of modeling
the learning process for the community. Anyone can be the teacher. [1]
