@title{Contracts, Strings and Images}

@overview{
This unit will introduce you to a set-mapping representation for functions, in which the function object exists as a means of translating points
from a Domain into a Range. Coupled with their understanding of Circles of Evaluation, students generalize their understanding of functions to
include other datatypes, including Strings and Images. 

@objectives[@item{Learn Racket syntax and grammar, using the Circle of Evaluation}
        @item{Learn how to define values to be used later, as variables}
        @item{Learn syntax for simple strings and image-composition expressions}]
@product-outcomes[
        @item{Learn to make and manipulate the basic elements of their games--numbers, strings, and images}]
