@boxed-text{@animated-gif{splash.png}What factors make some people live longer than others? Are the schools in one part of your neighborhood better than schools in another part? How would you measure that? Answering these questions involves collecting and manipulating data, from sports stats to record sales to census data. Our Data Science module teaches students to view programs as questions we ask of data. Students form their own questions about the world around them, and learn how to analyze data critically and carefully to find answers. Business, science, and social studies teachers can utilize this module to help students make inferences from data. Math teachers can use this module to introduce foundational concepts in statistics. It also works great as a module for AP CS Principles’ unit on data!}

Students can explore topics like Data Cleaning with @(hyperlink "https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/tables.html#%28part._s~3atables~3aloading%29" "Pyret Sanitizers"), transforming columns to detect non-linear relationships, using @code{if}-statements to transform categorical data to quantitative data, splitting tables to create subgroups, and lots more!}

Of course, there's more to a curriculum than software and lesson plans! We also provide a number of resources to educators, including standards alignment, an answer key for the programming exercises and forums where they can ask questions and share ideas.
