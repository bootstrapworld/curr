These question quickly turn into a discussion about data - how you measure it and how you interpret the results. In this course, you'll learn how to use data to ask and answer questions like this.  The process of learning from data is called @vocab{Data Science}. Data science techniques are used by scientists, business people, politicians, sports analysts, and hundereds of other different fields to ask and answer questions about data.

                            The Definitions Area is where programmers define values and functions in their program, while the Interactions Area allows them to experiment with those values and functions. This is analogous to writing a series of function definitions on a blackboard, and having student evaluate expressions using those function on scrap paper. As students are not yet defining values of their own, it is not important that students understand this distinction right now.  For now, we will work only with the Interactions area.

                            data.  In this case, the computer's job is easy because the program is already a value!  When we hit Run, we @vocab{evaluate} the program, which is another way of saying "give me the value that is produced by this program".

                            surprising to students at first, so you may want to take a moment to explain what's going on, and 
                            show them that these decimals can be converted back to fractions just by clicking on them.  The 
                            environment uses standard annotations for repeating, non-terminating decimal expressions and 
                            properly handles expressions like @math{(\sqrt -1)}.  If you want to work with those kinds of

                            Every value has a  @vocab{Type}.  Each of the values produced by the programs you just wrote are Numbers, but there are other types as well. One of these types is called a @vocab{String}.  A String
                            is a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, symbols) in between a pair of quotation marks.

                            The program @code{"4"} is a String.  Even though this string only contains the character for the number 4,
                            it is a String because it is between quotation marks.  Data scientists care about this distinction, because
                            we often run into data that is represented in a String but should be considered a number by Pyret.  This will
                            become more relevant later in the course, for now stress to the students that anything within quotations is 
                            a String.  Pyret is helpful in detecting strings because it highlights them green.

                            printed on the next line;  instead, we get a big red box.  This big red box is an @vocab{error message}.
                            The editor gives us error messages when a program can't be properly evaluated.


                            Error messages a way for the computer to help you find
                            small mistakes in your code.  In the case above,
                            without the second quotation mark the computer can't figure out when the end of the String is, which makes
                            evaluation impossible.

                            It is crucial to encourage students to read error messages and debug their code.  Often, when a student
                            encounters an error message for the first time, they will throw their hand up and tell the teacher 
                            "I did something wrong".  When helping students with this, make sure to ask questions about the answer 
                            rather than fixing code for them.

                            Let's break this down.  @code{2 + 5} is an expression, and this expression is made up of values
                            and an @vocab{operator}.  Here the operator is +, which you've seen in math classes:  adding two values to create a new value.

                            Now try leaving out the spaces around the plus sign. We get an error! This error happened because Pyret needs you to write spaces between numbers and operators.

                            Pyret requires this whitespace for code readability, and to remove ambiguity when dealing with negative numbers.  For example, without the white space rule, the program @code{5+-2} is hard to understand.

                    So now you know about Numbers, Strings, Operators and Variables - all of which behave just like they do in math. But what about functions? Pyret has lots of built in functions, which we can use to write more interesting programs than are possible with just operators and variables.

                            @activity[#:forevidence "BS-IDE&1&1"]{
                                    Let's explore a new function, @code{num-min}.  Type each of these
                                    lines of code into the interactions area and hit enter.

                                            }
                                            @item{
                                                    @code{num-min(-5, 2)}
                                            }
                                            @item{
                                                    @code{num-min(8, 6)}

                                    ]

                                    How many arguments does @code{num-min} have? What type of values does this function take in? What type of value does this function output?  How does this output relate to the arguments?
                            }

                            This is your first example of @italic{using a function} in Pyret. To use a function, a programmer writes:
                            @itemlist[
                                    @item{
                                            The name of the function.  This function's name is @code{num-sqr}
                                    }
                                    @item{
                                            The argument(s) we want to give to the function, wrapped in parentheses and separated by commas.  In this case, there is one argument:  The number we want to square.  However, different functions can have differents numbers of arguments.
                                    }
                            ]
                            Each function also outputs a value.  The @code{num-sqr} function outputs a number that is equal to the square of the argument. What do you think the function @code{num-sqrt} does?

                                            Pyret needs both parentheses around the arguments, so that 
                                            it knows exactly where function call begins and ends.  This
                                            is similar to the error with Strings needing both quotation
                                            marks.

                                            For a similar reason, Pyret needs a comma between each argument
                                            so that it can tell how many arguments there are.

                                            to a number, so an error is raised.

                            We do this by writing @vocab{contracts}. Contracts are comments in code that give the programmer instructions on what functions take in and output.  Below is the contract for @code{num-min}:

                            @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                                    # num-min : Number Number -> Number
                            }

                            The first part of a contract is the function name.  This function is @code{num-min}, so that part is easy.  @code{num-min} takes two arguments of type Number, so we write Number Number.  Finally, after the arrow goes the type of the function's output, which in this case is Number.
                            @activity{
                                Write the contract for @code{num-min} in the back of your workbook. What do you think the contract would be for @code{num-max}? Write it down, and then try using it in the Interactions area.

                            Pyret has many, many more functions. Some of these functions are defined as part of the language, and others are defined in extra files that we have to load by hand. Fortunately, including an external file is really easy! Try typing in the following code at the top of the Definitions Area:
                            @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                                include plot-list
                            }
                            This includes a file called @code{plot-list}, which defines a lot of extra functions for making charts, graphs and plots. When you click Run, Pyret will read that file and become aware of all those plotting functions.

                        Two functions imported by this file are called @code{plot} and @code{function-plot}:
                        @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                            # function-plot: (Number -> Number) -> Series
                            # plot : Series -> Plot
                        }
                        @code{function-plot} consumes any function that maps from Numbers to Numbers (xs to ys, for example), and returns a series representing the graph of that function. @code{plot} consumes that series, and produces a @code{Plot} object. Make sure you write these down in your contracts page!

                    @student{
                        We can define identifiers for both the series and the plot:

                            # define the series and the graph for the function f(x)=√x

                            sqrt-graph  = plot(sqrt-series)
                        }
                        Once we click Run, we can see what these values look like. The @code{plot-object} has a method we can call to display the series:
                        @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                            sqrt-graph.display()
                        }
                        Looking at your contracts page, do you see any other functions that we could plot?
