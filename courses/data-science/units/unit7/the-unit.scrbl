                              You may have noticed that answering these questions requires a little extra work, because the columns we need about are separated by a lot of uneccessary columns.  Finding the year "Maleficent" came out requires looking at the @code{title, year} columns, but not any of the columns in between.  It would be nice if we could choose only the columns we need, and put those into a new table.

                                      Type @code{movies-selected} into the Interactions Window.

                      @student{
                              When we want to answer questions about just a few columns in a table, @italic{we can remove the unecessary ones} with @vocab{select}.  @code{select} is a @vocab{table query}: a special key word that will create a new table using information from a starting table. Table queries are called queries because they are used to ask questions using specific information in tables. @vocab{select} creates a table containing only the columns that the programmer specifies.

                              @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                                      movies-selected = select title, year from movies end
                              }

                              Demonstrate the @code{select} query to the class, selecting different columns from the @code{movies} table.
                      }
                }
                @point{
                      @student{
                              The @code{select} keyword will choose the column names given (in this case, @code{title} and @code{year}) from the specified table @code{movies}, and create a new table with just those columns. If you turn to the back of your student workbook, on @worksheet-link[#:name "Query-Reference"], you'll find a reference sheet for this and other queries. This is a great place to take notes on how each query is used and to sweat the details. For example, pay close attention to the comma that separates the column names!

                                  In your own words, write down what a @code{select} query is for.
                              }

                      @teacher{
                              The benefits of using the @code{select} keyword are mostly for the programmer: having less columns does not make it significantly faster to perform operations on the table, but less columns does make it easier for humans to observe relations between columns (like in the examples above).

                              When thinking about select queries, we ask ourselves @bold{are any columns unecessary?} If the answer is no, we have no work to do. But if the answer is yes, we can zoom in and think about which columns we want to keep. Suppose we wanted to make a brochure showing local restaurants and ratings. "Are any columns unecessary?" The following code will select only the @code{country} and @code{continent} columns from the countries table, and bind the new table to the variable @code{countries-selected}:

                              @code[#:multi-line #t]{

                                Encourage students to think of the interactions area as a playground:  if a student needs to write a definition but don't know exactly how, they should experiment with different expressions in the Interactions Area until they are satisfied.

                                Pyret lets you change the order of a table's rows with the @code{order} query. This makes our questions a lot easier to answer quickly! For example, let's think back to our "most sodium" question...
                                
                                @activity[#:forevidence "BS-IDE&1&1"]{
                                        Return to your @editor-link[#:public-id "0BxJ2mGqPUGt0WWpheFVBNUNXX2s" "Unit 7"] template file. Type @code{presidents-ordered} into the interactions window.
                                }

                                Here, movies are in alphabetic order by title, from A to Z. The expression for ordering the @code{presidents} table is the following:

                                @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                                      movies-ordered = 
                                          order movies:
                                              title ascending
                                          end
                                }
                        }
                        @teacher{
                                 Demonstrate that this code can be crammed onto one line, but it may be more readable this way.                           
                        }
                }
                @point{
                        @student{

                                The key word @code{order} is followed by the name of the table we are ordering (in this case, @code{nutrition}), then a colon (@code{:}).  The colon always comes in front of an expression using column names.  In this case, we are ordering by the @code{sodium} column, in @code{descending} order.

                                @activity[#:forevidence "BS-IDE&1&1"]{
                                        Change the keyword @code{ascending} in the definition of @code{movies-ordered} to @code{descending}. Then hit Run and type @code{movies-ordered} into the interactions window. What has changed?
                                }

                                Now the table is in descending alphabetical order by the @code{title} column.  

                                @activity[#:forevidence "BS-IDE&1&1"]{
                                        What happens if we instead order the @code{movies-ordered} table by the @code{studio} column? 
                                }

                                It turns out you can order tables by columns Numbers AND Strings.  A table in ascending order by a String means it is in alphabetical order, and descending means reverse alphabetical order.

                            These table operations are even more useful when they are combined:

                                            Find the definition of @code{studio-and-gross} in the Definitions Area. What table is this query @italic{using}?
                                        }

                            This query does something you haven't seem before: @italic{it uses the result of a prior query}. We ordered our table by party and bound the result to @code{movies-ordered}, and now we're @code{select}ing only the relevant columns from that table. Note that the new table is @italic{still sorted}, even though we've dropped the column we used to sort!

                            Table Plans allow us to turn query-writing into series of questions. By focusing on just one question at a time, we minimize our chances of making mistakes, and give ourselves a way to retrace our steps if something goes wrong. Being comfortable with Table Plans takes time, but once you've mastered them you'll find it gets easier and easier to program complex table queries.

                          At this point, you may have noticed that your dataset contains a few "extreme" points that skew the results of your analysis. Perhaps one movie was a box-office failure, or a war in one country is artificially dragging down their life-expectency. These extreme points are called @vocab{outliers}, and sometimes it's best to remove them from your dataset in order to identify a pattern. Or perhaps you've decided you want to zoom in on a subset of the data, or break it apart and do an analysis on two different groups. Maybe you want to run a separate analysis for movies with female leads v. male leads, or analyze Democratic and Republican presidents separately. You don't know how to do this - yet - but that's exactly what we'll cover in the next lesson!
