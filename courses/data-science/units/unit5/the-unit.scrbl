                                Suppose a stranger invites you to play a game. You start by guessing a number between 2 and 12.  The stranger rolls two dice, and add the numbers together.  If that sum is the number you guessed, you win the jackpot, but if your number is wrong, then you lose your money. What are your odds of winning this game? Are they good enough that it's worth playing?

                                Unfortunately, we still don't know if 7 comes up often enough for this to be a game worth playing! We've used our measures of center to figure out the most frequent number, but just @italic{how frequent is it}?  We need some way of asking if 7 appears more than all the other numbers combined.

                                We can use a different kind of chart for visualizing @italic{how frequent values are} in a list of quantitative data.  This kind of chart is a called @vocab{histogram}, and it is similar to the bar charts you have seen before.

                                        Use @code{.display()} to see what the histogram looks like, then try changing the second argument from @code{11} to @code{1}. What do you think this argument means?

                                We want to count the number of times @italic{each} permutation shows up in the dice game. Since there are 11 possible values for each dice roll, we have 11 bars in our chart. Just like the frequency bar charts from last unit, the length of the bar corresponds with how frequent a value is.  For example, the longest bar the bar for 7, because 7 is the most frequent.  Notice the shape of the histogram: the further away from 7, the less common the number.

                                The roll 7 is definitely the roll that happens the most often.  However, it never
                                appears more than half of the 10000 rolls.  That means, most of the time we

Unlike bar charts, however, histograms provide extra features for @vocab{quantitative data}: the bars are ordered from left to right, and the bins can be resized. Both of these are only made possible because quantitative data can be compared - one bar can be said to be "greater than" than another bar, and a value can be said to be "within" the range of a bin. For categorical data, neither of these is the case, so we use bar charts instead of histograms.

                                In the dice roll game, there were 11 possible numbers that the dice roll could produce. Would it be helpful to have 20 bars? 30? What would happen if we only used 1?

                                Look back at your call to the @code{histogram} function for the dice game. In the first example, it made sense to use 11 bins because there were only 11 possible values that the pair of dice could produce.

                                @activity[#:forevidence "BS-IDE&1&1"]{
                                        What would happen if we only used 4 bins for the dice game?  What if we used 40?
                                        Try them out with new function calls in the interactions window.
                                }

                                Using only 4 bins gives us a histogram that is less helpful, because 11 bins more accurately covers the range from 2 to 12.  However, 40 isn't any more helpful, because there are so many bins that are empty. Choosing the right bin size helps us make sense of the data, and is a skill that every data scientist should practice.

                                For another example, let's look again at our favorite 4th grade class:

                                @build-table/cols[
                                        '("First" "Last" "Height")
                                        '(("\"John\"" "\"Jane\"" "\"Javon\"" "\"Angela\"" "\"Jack\"" "\"Dominique\"" "\"Sammy\"" "\"Andrea\"")
                                          ("\"Doe\"" "\"Smith\"" "\"Jackson\"" "\"Enriquez\"" "\"Thompson\"" "\"Rodriguez\"" "\"Carter\"" "\"Garcia\"")
                                          ("52.0" "49.1" "57.7" "52.5" "53.0" "51.1" "56.2" "50.8"))
                                         (lambda (r c) (para ""))
                                         3 8
                                ]

                                Suppose we had 100 different students in this table. If we want to make a histogram for their height, how many possible values are there? 10? 100? The values of heights have decimals.  If we want to have a bar for every possible height value, how many bars do we need?
                        }
                        @teacher{
                                Guide discussion towards the fact that there are infinitely many values that height could take, so we can't have a bar for each one.

                                We can't have a bar for every possible height, and having a bar for each student in the table isn't really helpful to us. This is where bin sizes come in really handy!

                                The histogram that you completed only has 5 bars, yet each possible value contributes to the height of a particular bar.  This is possible because each of the decimal values is put into a @vocab{bin}.  Each @code{bin} is a range of values that our data can take.
