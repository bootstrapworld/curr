                              So far we've answered questions by computing one or several numbers. The mean/median/mode are measurements that try to summarize a data set. These are useful, but often they do not give us "the whole picture" about a data set.   
                      }

                              Feel free to use motivating examples that students will see in your classroom, or examples from real life data sets.

                              Data scientists often use @vocab{charts} to give a graphical  representation of the data.  @vocab{Charts} are pictures, where some part of the picture relates to values in a data set.
                              You've already seen two kind of plots: a function plot and a scatter plot.  @vocab{Bar charts} are used to compare rows in a table by their entries in a particular column.  In this example, we are comparing each item on the menu by the amount of cholesterol it has.  The length of the bar relates to the amount of cholesterol:  shorter bars mean less cholesterol, and higher bars mean more cholesterol.

                                                }
                                                @item{
                                                      Which item has the second most cholesterol?

                                                      How much cholesterol does a grilled chicken sandwich have?

                      @teacher{
                              Highlight that you can very quickly see which items have the most cholesterol, compared to reading an entire table to find out.  Reading charts is advantageous for seeing how the rows relate to each other.  However, it's harder to read exact values from charts, as we see from the grilled chicken question.

                              Another chart used to compare rows in a table by some column is a @vocab{pie chart}.
                              In pie charts, each row of the table gets a slice of the pie, and the size of  the pie slice relates to the value of cholesterol:  bigger pie slice means more cholesterol, and a thinner slice means less cholesterol. 
                      }
                      @teacher{
                              Later in the unit we will present guidelines for when to use pie charts vs. bar charts. For this example, a bar chart is preferable, but we want students to understand that pie and bar charts are different pictures to represent the same kind of data: one column of labels (food item), and one column of values (cholesterol).

                              Bar and Pie charts are similar in some ways:
                              @itemlist[
                                      @item{
                                            Every row is represented, either as a bar or a pie slice.
                                      }
                                      @item{
                                            The value being examined is proportional to the size of the bar or pie slice.
                                      }
                              ]
                              What differences do you see between bar and pie charts?
                      }
                      @teacher{
                              Pie charts are useful for showing @italic{percentages}, or "how big is this row relative to the size of the whole?" Bar charts show the actual magnitude of each row, independently of the total value.
                      }
                }

                              In Pyet, you can easily construct pie charts and bar charts with functions.

                              Let's go through this code together:

                              @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                                    food-list        = extract food        from nutrition end
                                    cholesterol-list = extract cholesterol from nutrition end
                              }

                              @activity{
                                What does this code do?
                              }

                              You've seen this code before:  Extracting columns from a table as lists.  These lists are the labels and values (respectively) that will be used to create our charts.
                      }
                      @teacher{
                              If students cannot explain what these first two lines do, STOP and review.
                      }
                }
                @point{
                      @student{
                              @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                                    # Define some Series
                                    cholesterol-bar-series = bar-chart(food-list, cholesterol-list)
                                    cholesterol-pie-series = pie-chart(food-list, cholesterol-list)
                                    # Define some Plots
                                    cholesterol-bar-chart = bar-chart(food-list, cholesterol-list)
                                    cholesterol-pie-chart = pie-chart(food-list, cholesterol-list)
                              }

                              This code uses new functions you haven't seen before: @code{bar-chart} and @code{pie-chart}. As you might expect, the contracts for these function are:
                               @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                                    # bar-chart : List<String> List<Number> -> Series
                                    # pie-chart : List<String> List<Number> -> Series
                              }

                              What do the two arguments in their domains represent?
                              @itemlist[

                                            The first is the list of labels.  Each of these will be the @italic{name} of a bar or pie slice on the chart.
                                      }
                                      @item{
                                            The second is the list of values.  Each of these corresponds to the @italic{size} of a bar or slice on the chart.
                                      }

                              By filling in the last bar, you have created a bar chart.  However, there's something special about chart.  What is different about this bar chart from the ones we have created before?

                                            In this bar chart, we are using the @vocab{categories} of a column as the labels, and the @vocab{frequency} of each category as the value.

                              Here, we are looking at the Eye Color column, which contains categorical data. In this special kind of bar chart, we are computing the @vocab{frequency} of  each category, and that frequency relates to the length of each bar.  Since there are 3 people with brown eyes, the bar for Brown extends to 3 marks long.

                              This special kind of bar chart is called a @vocab{frequency bar chart}.  There's a function in Pyret that lets us build frequency bar charts from a list:
                              @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                                freq-bar-char : List<String> -> Series
                              }
                              Below is an example that computes the frequency of categories in the @code{home-state} column of @code{presidents}.

                              @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                                    home-state-list   = extract home-state from presidents end
                                    home-state-series = freq-bar-chart(home-state-list)
                              }

                              What does the argument to @code{freq-bar-chart} mean?
                      }
