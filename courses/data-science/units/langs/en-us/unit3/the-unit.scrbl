                        Table methods can be chained together, so that we can build, filter @italic{and} order a Table. For example:
                        @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                            # get a table with the nametags of all the fixed animals, ordered by species

                        }
                        This code takes the @code{animals-table}, and builds a new column. According to our Contracts Page, @code{.build-column} produces a new Table, and that's the Table whose @code{.filter} method we use. That method produces @italic{yet another Table}, and we call that Table's @code{order-by} method. The Table that comes back from that is our final result.

                    @teacher{
                        Suggestion: use different color markers to draw nested boxes around each part of the expression, showing where each Table came from.

                        Suppose we want to build a column and then use it to filter our table. If we use the methods in the wrong order (trying to filter by a column that doesn't exist yet), we might wind up crashing the program. Even worse, the program might @italic{work}, but produce results that are incorrect! When chaining methods, it's important to build first, then filter, and then order.

                        Wouldn't it be great if Pyret had a function that just took in a table of animals, and did these things for us?

We can modify the Design Recipe slightly to help us keep our method order straight, turning it into something called a @bold{Table Plan}. Turn to page @worksheet-link[#:name "Sorted-Age-Bar"].

Let's use our filtered bar chart as an example, which ties together all the pieces you've seen before.

                        We're going to build a function that does this for us, and we'll start with the name. Naming is more complex in Table Plans, since we want to name the function according to the most important parts of what it does. Since we're getting an alphabetically-sorted bar chart of their ages, we'll call it @code{sorted-age-bar}. Instead of consuming Rows, this time we're consuming and producing @italic{Tables}. This gives us the following:

                        @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                            # sorted-age-bar :: (animals :: Table) -> Table
                            # consume a table of animals, and produce a bar chart
                            # of their ages, sorted alphabetically
                        }
                    }
                    @teacher{
                        Ask students to volunteer other names - but push them to keep the relevant info as part of the name!

                    @student{
                        @bannerline{Step 2: Examples}
                        This is really similar to writing examples with the Design Recipe, but everything stays on paper. First, we write down a small sample of the @code{animals-table}, called an Example Table. This example should contain all of the @italic{relevant} columns, and enough rows to give us an idea for how the function should work. Then, on the righthand side, we write or sketch what we expect to get back.

                            @item{ In the Interactions Area, how would you @italic{use} this function, passing in the @code{example-table}? }
                            @item{ What would @code{sorted-age-bar(table)} evaluate to? }
                        ]
                        In this case, we care about the name and age columns. According to our contract we would need to call the function's name and pass in only a table. According to the purpose statement, typing @code{sorted-age-bar(example-table)} into the Interactions Area should give us a bar chart of all the animal's ages, sorted by name.

                        The final step is to define a function that executes our Table Plan. We'll do this in two parts. First, we'll define a table by applying our methods to the input. Then, we'll do something with that table to produce a result. We already know how to start:
                        @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                            # sorted-age-bar :: (animals :: Table) -> Table
                            # Consume a table of animals, and compute a bar chart 
                            # showing their ages, in alphabetical order
                            fun sorted-age-bar(animals):
                                ...         # define the table
                                ...         # produce the result
                            end
                        }
                    }
                    @teacher{
                    }
              }
              @point{
                    @student{
                        To define this table, we'll ask ourselves three questions, in order:
                        @itemlist[
                            @item{ 
                              Does our Result have more columns than our Sample Table? If so, we'll need to use @code{.build-column}. 
                            }
                            @item{ 
                              Does our Result have fewer rows than our Sample Table? If so, we'll need to use @code{.filter}. 
                            }
                            @item{ 
                              Does our Result have its rows in some order? If so, we'll need to use @code{.order-by}.
                            }
                        ]
                        @activity[#:forevidence (list "Data 3.1.1&1&2" "Data 3.1.1&1&4")]{
                            If the answer to any of these questions is "no", @italic{cross out that line in the template}.
                        }
                    }
                    @teacher{
                        Only @code{.order-by} is needed!
                    }
              }
              @point{
                    @student{
                        All three methods are needed, so we won't cross anything out. You're already familiar with definitions in Pyret, and that's what we'll use here. Let's start with the name @code{t} for Table.
                        @itemlist[
                            @item{ Are there more columns in our result? No, nothing new gets added. }
                            @item{ Are there fewer rows in our result? No, the whole table get plotted. }
                            @item{ Are the rows ordered? YES! According to our purpose statement, the animals are sorted alphabetically by name. }
                        ]
                        @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                            # sorted-age-bar :: (animals :: Table) -> Table
                            # cConsume a table of animals, and compute a bar chart 
                            # showing their ages, in alphabetical order
                            fun sorted-age-bar(animals):
                                t = animals # define the table
                                  .order-by("name", true)
                                ...         # produce the result
                            end
                        }
                    }
                    @teacher{
                        It may be helpful to start with the table definition all on one line, and have students see you break it up to accommodate chaining. Students should be reminded that both forms are valid, but encouraged to use the latter.
                    }
              }
              @point{
                  @student{
                        Now that we have our new table, @code{t} defined, what do we need to do with it? According to our purpose statement, we need to @italic{make a bar chart}.
                        @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                            # sorted-age-bar :: (animals :: Table) -> Table
                            # Consume a table of animals, and compute a bar chart 
                            # showing their ages, in alphabetical order
                            fun sorted-age-bar(animals):
                                t = animals # define the table
                                  .order-by("name", true)
                                bar-chart(t, "name", "age") # produce the result
                            end
                        }
                  }
                  @teacher{
                      Drawing arrows from the @code{t} expression on the last line back to the @code{t} definition on the first line would be a good idea here. Make sure students see the connection between "defining the table...and using it"!
                  }

If you look in the @bold{Examples} section, you'll see that the Result is written underneath the expression @code{sorted-age-bar(animals-table)}. That's the code that should give us the result, so let's type it in!

                        One theory is that people adopt smaller animals because they're easier to care for. How could we test that theory? Bar and pie charts are great for showing us how the values of a single column are distributed, but they can't help us see connections between @italic{two} columns.

                        Fortunately, Pyret lets us make many kinds of charts, including @vocab{scatter plots}! Here's the contract for @code{scatter-plot}, as well as an example of a scatter plot that examines the relationship between weight and adoption time.

                        Another theory is that people adopt younger animals because they are cuter. But cats, dogs, rabbits and tarantulas have very different lifespans! A 5 year old tarantula is still really young, while a 5 year old rabbit is fully grown. With differences like this, it doesn't make sense to put them all on the same chart! To do this analysis, we might have to make several charts, all of which do the same thing but operate on different tables: one for cats, one for dogs, etc.
