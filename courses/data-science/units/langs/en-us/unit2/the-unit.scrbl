      Students are introduced to the Animals dataset, practice making some charts of the data, and consider the kinds of questions that can be asked of a dataset. They also learn to define values, and to define functions using a structured approach to problem solving called the "Design Recipe". They then use these functions to filter the animals dataset.

                            This file contains some new code that you haven't seen before. As with our Shapes file, we have a few @code{include} lines which import useful libraries for our course. This time, we also include a library that lets us work with Google Sheets:
                            @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                              include gdrive-sheets

                            On line 9, the @code{load-spreadsheet} function is used to load our animal shelter spreadsheet from Google Drive, and give that file a name: @code{shelter-sheet}. After that, we see the following code:
                            @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                              # load the 'pets' sheet as a table called animals-table

                            Just as you saw with our @code{shapes} example, this code @italic{defines a new table}. This time, it's called @code{animals-table}, and it's loaded from our Google Sheet. You can see the names we are giving to each of the columns, called @code{name}, @code{species}, @code{gender}, @code{age}, @code{fixed}, @code{legs}, @code{pounts} and @code{weeks}. (We could use any names we want for these columns, but it's always a good idea to pick names that make sense!)

                      @teacher{
                            Have students look back at the column names in the Google Sheet, and in the @code{load-table} function. Point out that they refer to the same columns, even though they have different names!

                            You already know about the @code{.row-n} method, which consumes a number and produces a row from a table. But tables have other methods too! The @code{.order-by} method consumes a String (the name of the column you want to order) and a Boolean (true for ascending, false for descending). Try typing the following expressions into the Interactions Area. What do you get?
                            @code[#:multi-line #t]{

                      @teacher{
                        Have students share their noticings and wonderings. Ideally, at least one student will wonder if there's a way to make charts using only a @italic{subset} of the data!

                          You may already be wondering if there's a way to make charts using only a @italic{subset} of the rows in a table. For example: what if we want to make a bar chart showing only the ages of the cats at the shelter? To do this, we need to learn how to write functions of our own, which can tell us if an animal is a cat or not, fixed or not, and so on.

                        As you've seen, Pyret allows us to define names for values using the @code{=} sign. In math, you're probably used to seeing definitions like @math{x = 4}, which defines the name @code{x} to be the value @code{4}. Pyret works the same way, and you've already seen two names defined in this file: @code{shelter-sheet} and @code{animals-table}. We generally write definitions on the left, in the Definitions Area.
                        You can add your own definitions, for example:

                                In the Interactions Area, type the code that will look up if @code{animalA} is fixed or not.
                                Then type the code to look up if @code{animalB} is fixed or not. Repeat for @code{animalC} and @code{animalD}. Suppose I wanted to do this for every animal in the table?
                            }
                            This seems really repetitive, doesn't it? We keep typing the same thing over and over, but all that's really changing is the animal. Wouldn't it be great if Pyret had a function called @code{is-fixed}, that would do this for us?

                            To build our own functions, we'll use a series of steps called the @bold{Design Recipe}. The Design Recipe is a way to think through the behavior of a function, to make sure we don't make any mistakes with the animals that depend on us! The Design Recipe has three steps, and we'll go through them together for our first function.

                            @bannerline{Step 1: Contract and Purpose} The first thing we do is write a Contract for this function. You already know a lot about contracts: they tell us the Name, Domain and Range of the function. Our function tells us if an animal is fixed or not, so we'll call it @code{is-fixed}. It consumes an animal (represented by a @code{Row} in our table), and look up the value in the @code{fixed} column. A Purpose Statement is just a description of what the function does:
                            @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                              # is-fixed :: (animal :: Row) -> Boolean
                              # Consumes an animal, and looks up the value in the fixed column
                            }
                      }
                      @teacher{
                        Be sure to check students' contracts and purpose statements before having them move on!
                      }

                      @student{
                            @bannerline{Step 2: Write Examples} Examples are a way for us to tell the computer how our function should behave for a @italic{specific} input. We can write as many examples as we want, but they must all be wrapped in an @code{examples:} block and an @code{end} statement. Examples start with the name of the function we're writing, followed by an example input. Let's use some two pets we defined earlier for our first example.
                            @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                              # is-fixed :: (animal :: Row) -> Boolean
                              # Consumes an animal, and looks up the value in the fixed column
                              examples:
                                is-fixed(animalA) is animalA["fixed"]
                                is-fixed(animalB) is animalB["fixed"]
                              end
                            }
                      }
                      @teacher{
                            Make sure students understand (1) that @code{is-fixed} came from the Name in our contract, (2) that @code{sasha} and @code{fritz} came from the Domain in our contract, that (3) @code{animalA["fixed"]} came from our purpose statement, and the label also came from the variable name in our contract.
                      }
                }
                @point{
                      @student{
                            Why didn't we just write @code{true} or @code{false} after the @code{is}? In programming, just like in any other class, it's more important to @italic{show your work} than to just write down the answer. This helps programmers organize their thinking, and can be a useful way of fixing bugs later on. (If you never wrote down what you were thinking, how will you know where you went wrong?)

                          @bannerline{Step 3: Define the Function} After having written our examples, this part is easy! The part of the examples before @code{is} tells us how to begin. We start with the @code{fun} keyword (short for "function"), followed by the name of our function and a set of parentheses. This is exactly how all of our examples started, too. But instead of writing @code{mittens}, we'll use the @italic{label} that we gave it. Then we add a colon (@code{:}) in place of @code{is}, and continue to follow our examples, replacing anything we circled with the label. Finally, we finish with the @code{end} keyword.

                          You already know about the @code{.row-n} and @code{.order-by} methods. But suppose you want to get a table of only cats? Or a table of only animals that have been fixed? Try typing these expressions into the Interactions Area. What do you get?

                          Find the contract for @code{.filter} in your contracts page. The @code{.filter} method is taking in a @italic{function}, calling it on every row in the table, and producing a new table with only the rows for which it returns @code{true}.

                          }
                          Notice that the Domain for @code{.filter} says that @code{test} must be a function (that's the arrow), which consumes a @code{Row} and produces a @code{Boolean}. If the function we pass in produces anything else, we'll get an error.
