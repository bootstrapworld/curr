                                You now have significant experience asking questions about data sets: You know how to take measures of center, and how to visualize both quantity and distribution of quantitative and categorical data. Let's use this experience to find out if younger animals really do get adopted faster. First, we'll start with a sample of our dataset: the @code{animals-table}.

We can use these points to plot each animal as a point on the x- and y-axes. Eventually, we'll have a whole cloud of points, which show us the relationship between the two columns for all the animals at the shelter.

                                This visualization is called a @vocab{scatter plot}. Pyret has two functions for making scatter plots:

                                    # scatter-plot :: (t :: Table, xs :: String, ys :: String) -> Image

However, @code{labeled-scatter-plot} consumes another argument after the Table, which is a column that we will use to @italic{label each point}.

We could make a scatterplot of restaurant prices vs. reviews, an outlier that's high above the rest of the points would be a restaurant whose reviews are @italic{unusually good} for the price. An outlier way below the cloud would be a really bad deal.

                                You've already learned three ways to find the "center" of a dataset in one dimension: the mean, the median and the mode all represent a way to collapse a bunch of points on a number line into a single, summary number. If the "center" of points on a number line is a single point, what is the "center" of points in a @italic{two-dimensional} cloud?

                                What we need to do is find a @italic{line} - called a @vocab{predictor} - that is at the center of this cloud. Each point exerts a little bit of "pull" on the line, with points above the line yanking it up and points below the line dragging it down. Points that are really far away - our @vocab{outliers} - pull the line harder than those that are close to the line. The slope of the line will be positive or negative depending on whether or not the correlation is positive or negative. Given a value on the x-axis, this line allows us to "predict" what the corresponding value on the y-axis might be. This allows us to make inferences about a population, based on a sample of that population.

For example, suppose a study found that there was a strong correlation between the average per-person consumption of chicken and the amount of oil imported by the US. Those two values have similar patterns, but there is no causal relationship between them!
