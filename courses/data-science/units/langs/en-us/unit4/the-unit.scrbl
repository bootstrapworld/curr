                          You've now seen two kinds of charts for visualizing @italic{quantity}: @vocab{bar charts} and @vocab{pie charts}. Both charts involve quantities and labels: each bar and slice is a measure of a quantitative column, and each one has a label. Both charts help us look at the whole dataset at once, and answer questions about @italic{quantity}. As you've observed, bar charts are great when we want to know exactly "how much" of a thing is contained in a single row. Pie charts, on the other hand, are best when we want to know "what percent" of the thing in our table is contained in a single row.
