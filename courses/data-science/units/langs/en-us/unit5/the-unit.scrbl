    Students learn how to measure central tendency (using mean, median, and mode), as well as variation (visualizing quartiles with box plots). After applying these concepts to a contrived dataset, they apply them to their own datasets and interpret the results.

                              Pyret has a way for us to compute the @vocab{mean} of any column in a Table. It consumes a Table and the name of the column you want to measure, and produces the mean - or average - of the numbers in that column.

For example, the mean of a list of Presidents doesn't make sense.  Same thing for a list of zip codes:  even though we can and divide the numbers of zip codes, the output doesn't correspond to some "center" zip code.

These extreme points are called @vocab{outliers}, because they fall far outside of the rest of the dataset. Calculating the mean is great when all the points in a dataset are evenly distributed, but it breaks down for datasets with huge outliers.

But then they drew a conclusion without checking to see if that was the right statistic to look at. As Data Scientists, we had to look deeper into the data to find out whether or not to trust the Bureau.

                              You now have three different ways to measure center in a dataset. But how do you know which one to use? Depending on the variation in the dataset, a measure could be really useful or totally useless! Here are some guidelines for when to use one measurement over the other:

                              @itemlist[
                                      @item{
                                            If the data is unlikely to have values occurring multiple times, do not use mode. For example: grades can fall between 0-100, and it is possible that 100 students will get 100 different grades. The mode won't tell you anything! If, however, we were looking AP Test Scores (1-5), the mode could be very useful.
                                      }
                                      @item{
                                            If the data is going to have lots of outliers, the median gives a better estimate of the center than mean.

                          Data Scientists are skeptical people: they don't trust a claim unless they can see the data, or at least get some summary information about the center and variation in the dataset. In the next Unit, you'll investigate new ways to visualize variation and distribution.
