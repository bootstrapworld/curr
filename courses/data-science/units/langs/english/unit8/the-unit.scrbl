    Students explore new visualizations in Pyret, this time focusing on the @italic{frequency} of observations in their dataset. They learn how to construct and interpret Frequency Bar Charts and Histograms, experiment with these visualizations in a contrived dataset, apply them to their own research, and interpret the results.

                              What can we say about this table? How many rows and columns does it have? Are they categorical or quantitative? Could we talk about the mean, median or modes of some of these columns? Which ones?

                              What was different about these questions? What did the charts at the bottom tell us? The questions were all about @italic{frequency}. The first chart shows the frequency of different species in the table, and the second shows the frequency of certain @italic{weight-ranges}.

                              The first chart is called a @vocab{frequency bar chart}. It uses the @vocab{categorical data} in a column as the labels, and then @italic{counts how often} those categories show up in the table. In other words, it shows us the frequency with which each category appears in the table.

In this special kind of bar chart, we are computing the @vocab{frequency} with which each category occurs in our dataset. and that frequency relates to the length of each bar. Since there are 3 animals whose @code{species} is @code{"cat"}, the bar for Cat extends to 3 marks long.

But what if we wanted to see a frequency of quantitative data, like the weights of each animal? There are so many unique weights in our table that we'd have a hundred different bars, all the same size! What we want is a way to @italic{group the values into bins}, so all the animals weighing between 0 and 20 pounds are counted together, then the animals weighing 21-40 pounds, and so on.

                              The second chart is called a @vocab{histogram}.  Histograms are like frequency bar charts, but they have a few important differences:
                                @itemlist[
                                    @item{ Frequency bar charts are for categorical data, but histograms are for quantitative data }
                                    @item{ The bars in a histogram are @italic{ordered} according to the ranges of the bins }
                                    @item{ The size of the bins is adjustable }
                                ]
                              These differences are made possible because quantitative data can be @italic{compared} - one bar can be said to be "greater than" another bar, and a value can be said to be "within" the range of a bin. For categorical data, neither of these is the case, so we use bar charts instead of histograms. Frequency bar charts are only for counting the frequency of categorical data. In this chart, the weights of all the animals are groups into bins. How big are these bins?
