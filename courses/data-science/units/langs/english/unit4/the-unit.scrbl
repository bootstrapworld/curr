                        Table methods are different from @vocab{functions} in three important ways:

                                  }

                                Pyret lets you change the order of a table's rows with the @code{order-by} method. Let's take a look at the contract for this method, and an example of that orders the @code{animals-table} by species:

                                    What did you get? What will happen if you change @code{true} to @code{false}? How could you sort the table alphabetically by pet name? In order of oldest-to-youngest?

When we want to filter a Table, we can use the @code{.filter} method. The contract for this method is shown below, along with an example expression that filters the @code{animals-table} to show only those who are fixed.

                              Sometimes we want to @italic{add a column} to a Table, and we can use the @code{.build-column} method to do just that. The contract for this method is shown below, along with an example expression that adds a birth-year to the @code{animals-table}.

                                  In the Interactions Area, use the @code{.build-column} method to produce a table that includes a @code{nametag} column, which contains an image of the nametag for each pet.

                        Table methods can be chained together, so that we can build, filter @italic{and} order a Table. For example:
                        @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                            # get a table with the nametags of all the fixed animals, ordered by species
                            animals-table.build-column("year", birth-year).filter(is-fixed).order-by("species", true)
                        }
                        This code takes the @code{animals-table}, and builds a new column. According to our Contracts Page, @code{.build-column} produces a new Table, and that's the Table whose @code{.filter} method we use. That method produces @italic{yet another Table}, and we call that Table's @code{order-by} method. The Table that comes back from that is our final result.
                    }
                    @teacher{
                        Suggestion: use different color markers to draw nested boxes around each part of the expression, showing where each Table came from.
                    }
              }
              @point{
                    @student{
                        It can be difficult to read code that has lots of method calls chained together, so we can break them up before each "@code{.}"" to make it more readable. Here's the exact same code, written with line breaks:
                        @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                            # get a table with the nametags of all the fixed animals, order by species
                            animals-table
                              .build-column("year", birth-year)
                              .filter(is-fixed)
                              .order-by("species", true)
                        }
                    }
                    @teacher{

                              Can you chain these methods together correctly to answer the following questions?

                          Suppose we wanted to build a new column for a table, and then sort by that column. Compare the two lines of code below. Will they both work?

                    @student{
                          No - @italic{the second line will fail!} That's because - just as in math - order of operations matters! In the second line, the first method call will produce an error, because the @code{"total"} column does not exist as part of @code{some-table}. In the first line, first make a @italic{new table} by using @code{build-colum}, and then call @code{order-by} on that table. So how do you know when to use each method? You'll learn that in the next lesson...
