                              You've now seen two kinds of charts: @vocab{bar chart} and @vocab{pie charts}. Both charts involve quantities and labels: each bar and slice is a measure of a quantitative column, and each one has a label. Both charts help us look at the whole dataset at once, and answer questions about @italic{quantity}. As you've observed, bar charts are great when we want to know exactly "how much" of a thing is contained in a single row. Pie charts, on the other hand, are best when we want to know "what percent" of the thing in our table is contained in a single row.

Fill out a good Sample Table and write your result.

                        Bar and Pie Charts are powerful tools that make it easy to talk about the amount (or relative amount) of quantitative data in our dataset. But what if we wanted to see @italic{how many dogs v. cats there are in our dataset}? This question is about @italic{frequency} - specifically how often the @code{species} column is @code{"cat"} or @code{"dog"}. What if we wanted to know how many animals were between 1-10 pounds, 11-20 pounds, 21-30 pounds, and so on? Once again, that's a question about how @italic{frequent} a particular weight range comes up.
