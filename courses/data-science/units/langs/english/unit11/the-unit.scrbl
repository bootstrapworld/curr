                                Being able to talk about and understand linear regression is really important. It can be easy to misinterpret results, or to be seduced by the fancy-sounding phrase "linear regression"! As Data Scientists, you should be able to look at a chart and see if it really backs up the claim. Turn to @worksheet-link[#:name "Fake-News"] and see if you can spot what's wrong with each claim!

Turn back to @worksheet-link[#:name "Findings-My-Dataset"], and share your most interesting finding with the students sitting nearby.
