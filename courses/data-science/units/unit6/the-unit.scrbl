                                Suppose you're visiting a new city, and you want to go out for a great meal. Someone suggests a really expensive restaurant, and assures you it's the best in town. How do you know if you're being ripped off? You now have significant experience asking questions about data sets:  You know how to take measures of center, and how to visualize both categorical and quantitative data. Let's use this experience to find out if the expensive restaurants are really worth the money. First, we'll start with out data set: a table containing information about the restaurants in town.

                                @build-table/cols[

                                ]

                                Here the @code{name} column is the name of the restaurant, the @code{price} contains the average price of an entree at the restaurant, and the @code{rating} column contains the average star rating given by customers.

                                To answer this question, we will return to the very first chart you learned about in this class: @vocab{scatter plots}. A scatter plot is a chart that plots every pair of numbers in 2 columns. By extracting the two columns from @code{restaurants}, we can create a series to plot:
                                @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                                        ratings-list = extract rating from restaurants end
                                        prices-list  = extract price  from restaurants end
                                        prices-vs-ratings-series = scatter-plot(prices-list, ratings-list)
                                        prices-vs-ratings-plot = plot(prices-vs-ratings-series)
                                }
                                Click Run, and display the scatterplot for @code{prices-vs-ratings-plot}
                        }
                        @teacher{

                                @bitmap{images/price-vs-rating.png}
                                There are 9 points on our restaurant scatter plot: one for each restaurant in the table.  Each dot's placement depends on the price and rating values of a particular restaurant.  For example, look at the restaurant "Riverside Grille".  Riverside Grille has an average price of 19.56, so it will appear to the far right of the chart.  Riverside Grille has an average rating of 4.9, so it will appear towards the top of the chart.

                                Scatter plots are a simple way to visualize the relationship between two columns of quantitative data.  In this scatter plot, we can see a general trend that restaurants with higher price tend to be rated higher.  This particular example might seem intuitive, but it's a lot easier to search for relationships in data using a visualization than a table by itself.

This relationship is called a @vocab{positive correlation}, because an increase in one measurement (price) tended to result in an increase in the other (rating). What do you think it would mean if we saw a @vocab{negative correlation}?

                                Scatter plots are useful when searching for a relationship between two columns of quantitative data.  Often, if we find a relationship, we can use that relationship to make predictions.  For example, we predicted that a restaurant with a price of $16 would have a rating somewhere between 4 and 5. A prediction summarizes the relationship within our data cloud, for example "for every $4 in price, a restaurant's rating tends to be a full point higher".

                                Correlations help us make predictions, but not every prediction is right! We might predict that a cheap restaurant won't be as good as a fancy one, but sometimes the local diner is actually better than fancy bistro! Height is positively correlated with being good at basketball - but that doesn't mean a taller player is @italic{always} better!

                                We can represent a positive correlation by drawing a line on a scatter plot, representing the prediction.

                                This line is the graph of a @vocab{predictor} function. A @italic{predictor} is a function that takes in a value for one variable, and returns an estimate of a different variable, based on all the other points in the cloud.  In our example, we can predict the rating of a restaurant, based on its price.

                                This line would give close predictions for restaurants with average prices around $4 or $6, but for higher prices it's completely wrong. What makes this predictor so bad?

                                Data scientists use statistics to build a @italic{model} of a data set. This model takes into account a lot of different measures (including some of the ones you already know), and tries to identify patterns and relationships within the data. We can build a model of our own in Pyret, and grab a @italic{predictor function} from it:

                                @code{linear-regression} is a function that takes 2 lists as arguments, and returns a function of Type @code{Number -> Number}. This function is our predictor, representing the line that best fits the data. We define this function to be the identifier @code{rating-predictor}, and we can use it just like any other function.

                                        Type @code{rating-predictor(0)} into the Interactions Area. What is the output?  What happens with @code{rating-predictor(20)?} What is the contract for @code{rating-predictor}?

Ideally, we'd like to plot these @italic{on top of one another}, and we can do this using the @code{plots} functions.

In other words, it's a measure for how well the line fits. A perfect score of 1.0 means that 100% of the variability in the data is explained by the function, and that our predictor is perfect. For the price vs ratings, the predictor score is ~0.71, which is fairly accurate. The contract for @code{r-squared} is:

                                Have your students examine the r-squared values for the life expectancy models. Population size has virtually no correlation, but GDP has roughly 30%! Is this surprising to the students? Did they expect it to be stronger or weaker? How can they explain the result?
                                Optional: teach your students how r-squared values are calculated.

                                Suppose you could divide your data up, perhaps by the @italic{kind of restaurant}, or by the @italic{neighborhood where the restaurant is located}. If you ran a linear regression on a per-neighborhood basis, do you think you would find a stronger correlation? Perhaps a different correlation? If your dataset includes both men and women, you might want to re-run the analysis on the genders separately. To do any of this analysis, you'll need to learn how to @italic{manipulate tables}, so you can sort them, break them apart, or add new columns. The next three units will show you how to do just that.
