As data scientists, we need to write programs that work on complex data like @italic{restaurant menus}, which can have many related parts and contain dozens or millions of entries. A collection of related data that can be grouped and manipulated by a computer is called a @vocab{dataset}. In this unit, you will learn how Pyret works with real-world data, and how to answer data science questions like this one by writing programs over that data.

                            As you learned in Unit 1, Pyret allows us to define names for values and expressions, so that we can refer to them later. Every definition you've seen involves an identifier, followed by the equals sign, and an expression to bind to that name. For example, we can define the identifier @code{name} to be the string @code{"Tara"} by writing
                            @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                                name = "Tara"

                            The definitions area contains code to load two tables from Google Sheets; @code{presidents} and @code{nutrition}.  As you saw at the beginning of the lesson, tables need header rows to describe them! The @code{load-table:} block specifies the header row for the table being imported! Each of these @code{load-table:} blocks comes after an @code{=} operator which defines the variable names as these tables.

              								The @code{include} statement allows Pyret to use a supplementary module which can talk to the Google Sheets API.  This lets students use/apply functions that take data from Google Sheets.

              						@item{
              								The @code{load-spreadsheet} function applications are what will find particular spreadsheets and their content.

              								The @code{load-table} command is what actually loads a table that we can use in the interactions window.

(in other words, does John Doe have more height than Andrea Garcia), it can be answered by comparing their entries in the height column. John Doe's height is bigger than Andrea Garcia's, so we can say yes, he is taller.

                              Tables are 2-dimensional collections of data, but we often want to ask 1-dimensional questions of them.

We need some way of looking at each column individually in our programs.  In other words, we often want to get 1-dimensional data @bold{out of of a 2-dimensional table}.

                            In what ways are Lists different from Tables? Tables are 2-dimensional, while Lists are 1-dimensional. Tables also have a @italic{header row}, which associates a name with each column. Lists, on the other hand, have no header.  

                            However, List do share some qualities with tables. They have multiple entries, and those entries are in a specific @italic{order}. They can also be filled with either quantitative or categorical data. In the next lesson, we'll learn about functions that let us ask questions of lists, to help us look for ways to measure a set of data.

This time, instead of using @code{function-plot} we'll use @code{scatter-plot}, which takes in two lists of numbers.

							             Congratulations! You've just learned the basics of the Pyret programming language, and how to use that language to answer a data science question. Throughout this course, you'll learn new and more powerful tools that will allow you to answer more complex questions, and in greater detail.

								            Make sure to save your work.  Hit the Save button in the top left. This will save your program in the code.pyret.org folder within your Google Drive.

							               If your students are working in pairs/groups, make sure that each student has access to a version of the program.  The student who saved the program to their Google Drive can share their program with anyone by hitting the Publish button in the top left, choosing "Publish a new copy", then clicking the "Share Link" option.  This will allow them to copy a link to the program, then send to their partners in an email/message.
