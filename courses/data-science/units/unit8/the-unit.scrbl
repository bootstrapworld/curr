Computer scientists and data scientists use Boolean values whenever they are asking @italic{yes or no questions} of data.  For example, the expression @code{2 > 1} is asking "is 2 greater than one?". The answer is yes, so the computer will produce @code{true}.

                              Let's explore this query piece by piece:
                              @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                                    restaurants-sieved = sieve restaurants using rating:
                                        rating >= 4
                                    end
                              }

                              @itemlist[
                                    @item{
                                          Every @code{sieve} query starts with the same keyword: @code{sieve}.
                                    }
                                    @item{
                                          Next we name the table we want to sieve.  In this case, it is the @code{restaurants} table.
                                    }
                                    @item{
                                          After the table name comes the keyword @code{using}, which tells Pyret what columns are being used to ask a question of each row.
                                    }
                                    @item{
                                          Then we give the names of each column being used, followed by a colon @code{:}. In this case we are only using one column, which is the @code{rating} column.
                                    }
                                    @item{
                                          On the next line is the most important part: this is a @vocab{boolean} expression that asks the question "is the restaurant's rating at least 4.0?".  Notice that we can use the column name the same way we can use a variable, within this expression.
                                    }
                                    @item{
                                          Finally, like all table queries, we finish with the @code{end} keyword.

                          Data scientists often have to work with enormous tables, containing thousands or even millions of rows! When figuring out your table plan, it's helpful to create just a small "starter table" so you can think things through. But what makes a good starter table?
                          @itemlist[
                              @item{
                                  A good starter table contains @italic{at least} the columns that matter - whether we'll be ordering, selecting, or sieving by those columns.

                                  A good starter table has enough rows to be a representative sample of the dataset.
                              }
                              @item{
                                  A good starter table has rows in truly random order, so that we'll notice if we need to order the table or not.
                              }
                              @item{
                                  A good starter table has a representative sample of rows from our full table. For example, a starter table based on @code{presidents} isn't very good if it only has Democratic presidents, or only presidents from the 1800s. That's a sampling bias that makes it harder to realize what we need to @code{sieve} by!
