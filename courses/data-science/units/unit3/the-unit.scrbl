                          According to the US Census Bureau, the average American household earned more than $45,000 in 2003 - more than 3x the poverty line that year. Can we conclude that only a small percentage of Americans were in poverty that year?

Now that you are familiar with how tables organize data, it's time to solve some problems with them. We already know how to evaluate an identifier once a program has been run: we just type the identifier into the Interactions Area and hit "Enter" to see the value. For example, we can type the identifier @code{presidents} or @code{nutrition} into the interactions window, and we see the table. There are some other identifiers defined here - what are their names?

                              To make a list, we use square brackets and the @code{list:} constructor, followed by a comma-separated list of values. What is the type of @code{a}?

Maybe we want to split a list of players into two teams, or find the most common birthday in our group of friends. All of these involve taking 1-dimensional data and asking questions about it's "center", but there are several different kinds of center.

                              We calculate the mean by adding up each element in the list, and dividing by the number of elements in that list.

                              For example, the @vocab{mean} of the list @code{[list: 1, 4, 5, 8, 2]} is calculated by @code{(1 + 4 + 5 + 8 + 2) / 5}, which evaluates to 4.
                      }
                      @teacher{

                              }

                              Notice that calculating the @vocab{mean} requires being able to add and divide, so the @vocab{mean} only makes sense for quantitative data.  For example, the mean of a list of Presidents doesn't make sense.  Same thing for a list of zipcodes:  even though we can add and divide the numbers of zipcodes, the output doesn't correspond to some "center" zipcode.

                              Here @code{2} is the median, because it separates the "top half" (all values greater than @code{2}, which is just @code{3}), and the "bottom half" (all values less than or equal to 2).

                              If students are not already familiar with median, we recommend the following
                              "pencil and paper algorithm" for median finding over a list:

                              @itemlist[
                                      @item{

                                            Repeat these steps until there is only one number left in the list.  This number is the median. If there are two numbers left, take the mean of those numbers, for reasons explained in the next point.
                                      }
                              ]

                              For lists that have an even number of elements, this question is a little trickier.

                              There is no one number in the list separating the top half and the bottom half, because there are only 2 numbers!  In this case, we take the @vocab{mean} of the two middle numbers.  So here, the median is @code{(2 + 3) / 2} which evaluates to @code{2.5}.

                              This list has multiple modes:  @code{1, 4}, because they appear equally often, and more than other elements in the list.

                              @code{mode} will return the smallest mode, which is a Number, but @code{modes} will return a List<Number> containing all of the modes.  Their contracts are:

                          In the last lesson, you learned how to @code{extract} a column from a table, turning it into a list. Now let's use that knowledge to start asking questions about some of our datasets. Suppose we wanted to know what the average number of calories are on the menu. We'd need to first extract that column from the table, and then take the @code{mean} of the resulting list. We can write this using identifiers:

                          @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                              calorie-list = extract calories from nutrition end
                              mean(calorie-list)
                          }

                          ...or as a single expression, by combining the @code{extract} expression with mean:
                          @code[#:multi-line #t]{
                              mean(extract calories from nutrition end)
                          }
                          Which style do you like better? Why?
