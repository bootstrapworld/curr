The Computational Modeling in Physics with Bootstrap module (colloquially known as "Bootstrap:Physics") is current under development, in partnership with the @(hyperlink "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_of_Physics_Teachers" "American Association of Physics Teachers"), the @(hyperlink "https://modelinginstruction.org/" "American Modeling Teachers Association"), and @(hyperlink "http://stemteachersnyc.org/" "STEM Teachers NYC"). This module helps students understand basic physics concepts by incorporating computer programming as one of the key tools for building models of the physical world. The module is targeted at ninth grade, a year in which every student is expected to take science. The module is aligned to the Physics First course, allowing teachers to easily embed computational modeling in their physics classes.
