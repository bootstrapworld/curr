@point{@student{

  In Bootstrap:1, you learned about the @code{cond} syntax for writing
  @emph{conditional expressions}, which would ask questions and pick different
  answers depending on the results.  Pyret has a similar feature, the @code{if}
  expression.

  @activity{
    Open the file at @editor-link[#:public-id "0B9rKDmABYlJVaUw0VjdiOE5DVzQ" "What to Wear"]. After reading through the definition for the @code{wear} function:

    @itemlist[

      @item{Click Run, so that you can use @code{wear} in the interactions area.}

      @item{What does @code{wear(50)} evaluate to?}

      @item{What does @code{wear(100)} evaluate to?}

      @item{What is the domain and range of the @code{wear} function?}

      @item{What is the name of the variable in the @code{wear} function?}

      @item{Change the @code{wear} function to return the shorts outfit when it's cold
      (less than 30 degrees).}

      @item{@bold{Challenge:} Change the @code{wear} function to use Celsius degrees
      rather than Fahrenheit.}

    ]
  }
}

@teacher{}}

@point{@student{The @code{if} expression is similar to the @code{cond} expression from Racket
  in Bootstrap:1.  The difference is in the syntax; the
  behavior is the same. An @code{if} expression has a few parts, in order:

  @itemlist[
    @item{An @code{if} clause}
    @item{Any number of @code{else if} clauses}
    @item{An optional @code{else:} clause}
    @item{An @code{end} keyword}
  ]

  The @code{if} clause has a question, followed by a @code{:} (a colon),
  followed by an answer for if the question evaluates to @code{true}.  Each
  @code{else if} clause also has a question, followed by a colon, followed by
  an answer for if the question evalautes to @code{true}. Just like in Racket, the @code{else:} clause runs if none of the questions in the other clauses evaluated to @code{true}.  It catches all the cases that aren't covered by a specific question in one of the @code{if} or @code{else if} clauses.

}
@teacher{We mention that the @code{else:} clause at the end of an @code{if} expression is optional. Typically, it is important to make sure your code will account for all possible conditions, and ending with @code{else:} is a useful catchall condition if all of the other conditions return false. However, this is optional in the case that every single possible condition is covered by @code{else if} statements.}
}

@point{@student{At this point, we need to remember an important lesson about the Design
  Recipe for conditionals from Boostrap:1. If we look at the examples for @code{wear}, and circle everything that
  changes, both the input (the temperature) and the output (the image) change.
  However, @code{wear} only has a single variable according to the domain in
  its contract.  Also, the image is completely dependent on the temperature –
  it isn't a separate independent variable, so it wouldn't make sense for it to be another element in the domain of @code{wear}. The fact that we have @emph{more changing things than elements in the domain} tells us that @code{wear} must be a @vocab{piecewise function}.  This is the same rule as in Bootstrap:1, and just as we could in Racket, we can tell that a function must be piecewise just by looking at its contract and the examples.  This helps us identify when a function we are writing in our games needs to use @code{if}, as long as we follow the Design Recipe when building it.

}
@teacher{ This is an important point to review.  Conditionals, or Piecewise functions, are a big moment in
  Bootstrap:1, and the extension of the Design Recipe is key for
  students to design their own piecewise functions later on.  In the next
  exercise, make sure they use the Recipe steps to remind them of the mechanics
  of this type of function.

detect where characters are, and make decisions based on that information.

@code[#:multi-line #t]{
# location :: JumperState -> String
# Consumes a JumperState and produces a String 
# representing the location of the jumper: either "cliff", "beach", "water", or "air"

}
Copy the work you have in your workbok to implement @code{location} on the computer.

}

@teacher{}
}

@point{
  @student{In addition to writing your examples, you can also check that the @code{location}
function's behavior matches what a drawing of a @code{JumperState} instance
shows.  For example, if @code{location} returns @code{"cliff"} on some input,
when we draw that same input, it ought to look like the parachutist has hit the
cliff!

@activity[]{Experiment with this function:  in the interactions pane, run @code{location(START)}:
what does it return (hopefully @code{"air"})?  Run @code{draw(START)}: does it
look like the jumper is in the air?  Do the same for an instance of a JumperState where the jumper is on the cliff, in the water, and on the beach.

}


  }
  @teacher{This kind of experimenting shows an important connection between functions that
work with instances of a data structure, and the way we draw those instances.
We have, in our design for the animation, an understanding of what different
regions of the screen mean.  Here, we see that the @code{draw} and
@code{location} functions both share this understanding to give consistent
information about the animation.}

Currently, the sun's x and y-coordinate change to make it move across the screen and disappear behind the horizon. In this unit, we'll make the animation a bit more realistic, by changing the @italic{color} of the sun as it gets lower in the sky. At the top of the screen, the sun should be yellow, then change to orange as it gets to the middle of the screen, and then become red as it reaches the bottom, close to the horizon.  
                                 @activity{Talk with your partner about how you might make this happen. Will you need to add something new to your @code{SunsetState} data structure, or can you change the look of your animation based on what is already there?}}

Once students have brainstormed with their partners, have a classroom discussion to have pairs share their ideas. For groups with different implementation ideas, encourage them to solve the problem their way, and share the differences in their code at the end of class.}}
                 @point{@student{Since the color of the sun will be changing, this is something we @italic{could} add to the @code{SunsetState} data structure, as a String. However, the color will not change independantly: we want the color to change based on the position of the sun in the sky, and get darker as it gets lower. @activity{@itemlist[@item{Will the color of the sun change based on its x or y position?}
                    @item{What function in your code determines how your animation @italic{looks}?}
                    @item{How might you change this function to draw a different scene depending on where the sun is located in the scene?}]}
                                                                                                   
We know we'll need to change our @code{draw-state} function in some way, since this is the function that controls how our animation is drawn. Our first instinct may be to turn it into a piecewise function, and draw something different when the @code{SunsetState}'s y-coordinate gets below 225 or below 150. @italic{however}, if we were to start coding, we might quickly find that we're writing the same code over and over. We don't want to change how large the sun is, or where the ground is drawn in the scene. The @italic{only} thing we want to change is the actual image of the sun. To do this, we can write a @vocab{helper function} to ask questions about the @code{SunsetState}, and produce an image based on its y-coordinate, instead of doing that work inside @code{draw-state}. @vocab{Helper functions} are incredibly useful if you find yourself writing the same piece of code over and over again, or if you simply want to make your code more readable. In this case, we're going to write a function called @code{sun-color}, which will help us draw a picture of the sun separate from everything else in @code{draw-state}.

@activity{Open your wokbook to @worksheet-link[#:page 222 #:name "sun-color"]. Here we have directions for writing a function called @code{sun-color}, Which consumes a @code{SunsetState} and produces an image of the sun, whose color is either "yellow", "orange", or "red" depending on its y-coordinate.}}
                        @teacher{The word problem assumes a background scene size of 400x300 pixels. Once students use their @code{sun-color} function in their animation, they may need to change the specific conditions if they have a much larger or smaller scene.}}
                 
                 @point{@student{Once you've completed and typed the @code{sun-color} function into your @editor-link[#:public-id "0B9rKDmABYlJVSm94cFA4T3R2NTA" "sunset animation"] program, it will need to be used within one of our main animation functions: either @code{draw-state} or @code{next-state-tick}.
                      @activity{@itemlist[@item{Which of these functions do you think will use @code{sun-color}? @bold{Hint: Which function handles how the animation looks?}}
                                          @item{How does @code{draw-state} currently know how the sun looks? What does it look like in the animation right now?}
                                          @item{How could you change the code so instead of always drawing the sun as a solid yellow circle, you instead draw the image returned by @code{sun-color} at the @code{SunsetState}'s x and y-coordinate?}]}
                      Inside of @code{draw-state}, your code should look similar to:
                      
@code[#:multi-line #t]{fun draw-state(a-sunset):
  put-image(rectangle(WIDTH, HORIZON-HEIGHT, "solid", "brown"),
    200, 50,
    put-image(sun-color(a-sunset),
      a-sunset.x, a-sunset.y,
      rectangle(WIDTH, HEIGHT, "solid", "light-blue")))
end }

@activity{Once you've completed changing the color of the sun, have it wrap around: after "setting" behind the horizon, have it reappear back at the top left corner of the scene, and repeat its journey. Think about what color the sun will be when it wraps back around. Will it be red (the last color it had at the bottom) or will it return to being yellow?}
}
                         @teacher{This question about the color of the sun is an especially good question-and it likely to come up-from students who may have experience prohgramming with variables and updates in other languages, such as Scratch.

                                 @point{@student{@bold{Optional:}In addition to changing the color of the sun, have the background color change as well: it should be light blue when the sun is high in the sky, and get darker as the sun sets.}
