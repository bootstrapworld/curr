 @; EDIT HEADING TEXT HERE

@boxed-text{@animated-gif{../../splash.png}Bootstrap:Blank (or "Bootstrap:1") applies mathematical concepts and rigorous programming principles to creating a simple videogame, and 
            is aligned to @(hyperlink "../../../../Standards.shtml" "National and State Standards") for Mathematics, as well as the CSTA standards and K12CS 
            frameworks. Students create a simple, 3-character game involving a player, a target and a danger. They design 
            what each character looks like, and use algebraic concepts to detect collisions, handle keystrokes, and determine how they 
            move and interact.}

Of course, there's more to a curriculum than software and lesson plans! We also provide a number of resources to educators, including standards alignment, an answer key for the programming exercises and forums where they can ask questions and share ideas.
