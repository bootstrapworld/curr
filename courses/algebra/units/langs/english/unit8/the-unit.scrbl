                                    We discussed this earlier in the unit using circles: two circles collide when the distance between them is less than the sum of their radii. 
                                    If your objects have more interesting outlines than circles, this computation can be hard to do precisely.  Fortunately, most games don't have to be precise
                                    (they move too fast for people to see the exact moment of impact).  We just need to figure out when items are close enough, and use that to detect collision.}
