@lesson[#:title "Question One:"]{You are planning a trip to the grocery store, and want to make a list and determine the total cost of the trip at the same time. Three grocery items are defined below as an example. Their values are the cost of the item.
                                 @bitmap{grocery.png}
@itemlist/splicing[@item[@code{(define NUTELLA 6.99)}]
                   @item[@code{(define EGGS 2.50)}]
                   @item[@code{(define BANANAS 2.50)}]]
Define two more items for your grocery list.

@fill-in-the-blank[#:id "grocery1"]

@fill-in-the-blank[#:id "grocery2"]
                   
Write an expression (using your newly-defined items) which will give you the total cost of the items on your grocery list.

@fill-in-the-blank[#:id "exp1" #:columns 80]

When you get to the checkout line, you discover an old gift card in your pocket, worth $12.50. Define a new variable called "GIFTCARD". 

@fill-in-the-blank[#:id "gc"]

Finally, write another expression using your variables which calculates the new value of all your groceries once you've used the gift card.

@lesson[#:title "Question Two:"]{Why do you think it is important to write examples before writing code?

@lesson[#:title "Question Three:"]{Take a few minutes to try and solve this brainteaser. Then move on to the problem on the next page.

A frog's lily pad doubles in size every day. On the 12th day, it covers the entire pond. On which day will it cover half the pond?
@fill-in-the-blank[#:id "pad"]@bitmap{tree-frogsmall.png}}

@lesson[#:title "Question Four:"]{
@design-recipe-exercise["grow" "Assuming the lily pad does double in size every day, follow the steps below to use the design recipe and write the function grow, which takes in the size of the lily pad, and returns its size the next day."]}

When complete, go @hyperlink["http://www.wescheme.org/view?publicId=under-charm-madly-truck-grand" "here"] and insert your grow function to see your code in action!
