@boxed-text{@animated-gif{splash.png}Bootstrap:Reactive (or "Bootstrap:2") goes deeper into programming, building events and data structures on top of the foundation 
             laid by our intro course and allowing students to build far more sophisticated programs. Students learn how the world-based event 
             loop that drives their Bootstrap:Algebra game works, and use it to create animations using simple datatypes for their world. 
             They then learn about data structures, and design a World structure for a sophisticated game of their own design. 
             Bootstrap:Reactive is @(hyperlink "http://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/Standards.shtml" "aligned") to the CSTA standards and 
             K12CS frameworks.}

Of course, there's more to a curriculum than software and lesson plans! We also provide a number of resources to educators, including standards alignment, an answer key for the programming exercises and forums where they can ask questions and share ideas.
