                                    The parachute jumper jumps out of the airplane and falls straight down, into the water! It's much safer to land on the shore. Let's take a look at the code to see why he falls into the water instead. There are a few new concepts in this file, but first, let's focus on what you already know.
                                    @activity[#:forevidence (list)]{Look at the function defined here called @code{next-position}. @itemlist[@item{What is this function's Domain? Its Range?}
          @item{What does @code{next-position} do with its inputs?}]}
                                    This function takes in two numbers, representing the x and y coordinate of the parachute jumper, but it changes and returns only the y-coordinate, by subtracting 5 from it. But if only the y-coordinate is changing, he'll always fall straight down, landing in the water every time. To reach the land, he'll have to fall diagonally. How could we make that happen?
                                    @activity[#:forevidence (list)]{How should the jumper's x-coordinate change if he moves diagonally to the right (toward the land)? How should his y-coordinate change?}}

                    @point{@student{Functions can return only one thing at a time, but we need to return both an x @bold{and} a y-coordinate in order to make the jumper move diagonally. Thankfully, we have a way to combine multiple things within one container, called a @vocab{Data Structure}. Just like Racket and Pyret have built-in functions and also let you define your own functions, these languages allow you to create your own data structures as well. For this project, we've created a structure for you to use called @code{JumperState}, which contains two Numbers, representing an x and a y-coordinate.                                                                            @activity{Look at line 6, where we've defined @code{JumperState}. We'll go through the new syntax for defining a data structure, because very soon you'll be defining brand new structures of your own!}
                            @itemlist[@item{First, we've written a comment to remind ourselves what we're creating. In this case, we're calling our new structure @code{JumperState}, which contains two numbers: an x and y-coordinate.}
                                      @item{The next line begins with @code{data JumperState:}. Similar to the keyword @code{fun} you learned in the last lesson, @code{data} tells the computer that you're about to define a new type of data. This is a @bold{very} powerful  piece of code: In Bootstrap:Algebra, you wrote programs using four @vocab{data types}: Numbers, Strings, Images, and Booleans. In this course, now you can create brand new data types. We can use these data types to create complex animations, multi-player video games, or account for both coordinates of a parachute jumper, so he moves in 2-dimensions! We called this data type @code{JumperState}, because it represents the current state, or position, of the parachute jumper.  Pyret would let us write any name after @code{data}, but as a convention, the name of a new data structure is capitalized, and we choose a meaningful name for it.}
                                      @item{The next line begins with the | symbol, sometimes called a "bar" or "pipe", followed by the name of the @vocab{constructor} function for the structure (in this case, @code{jumper}.)  A @vocab{constructor} function is similar to some functions you've seen before, for creating images.  To create an Image, we call the function that creates it: @code{rectangle}, @code{triangle}, @code{square}, etc. Similarly, to create a @code{JumperState}, we can use the @code{jumper} @vocab{constructor} function with its inputs (two numbers, called x and y).  Again, the names @code{JumperState} and @code{jumper} were chosen by us, the programmer, and putting them in a @code{data} definition makes them available as a new data type and as a constructor function.}] 
                                                                                       Let's get back to constructing a @code{jumper}, specifically how we knew the inputs would be numbers. The block of code we've given you defines all of this! @code[#:multi-line #t]{data JumperState:
       | jumper(
          x :: Number, 
          y :: Number)
    end}
   
tells us that we're defining a new data type called @code{JumperState}, whose constructor function @code{jumper} takes in two things: x, which is a Number, and y, which is also a number. Once we've listed each input and its data type, we finish defining the structure with the @code{end} keyword, just like finishing an @code{example} block.
@activity{In the interactions area, practice making some @code{JumperState}s using the @code{jumper()} constructor function. Try making a @code{JumperState} that represents the parachute jumper's position if they're in the water, another when they're in the air, over the cliff, and one when they're on the beach.}}

                                   Now that we know everything that is part of a cake, we can use a data structure to represent the cake itself. Let's take a look at how this works.
                                   @activity{Open your workbook to @worksheet-link[#:name "Cakes"].}
                                   On this page, we will define a data structure for cakes, which we call @code{CakeType} (since this is now a new data TYPE). At the top of this page we see a comment, stating what things are part of a @code{CakeType}. Below that is a line that says @code{data CakeType:}, which begins the definition of a new data structure, called CakeType. On the next line, we define the function that makes a CakeType (@code{cake}), and how @italic{exactly} to make a CakeType---the names of each thing in a CakeType, and their data types. Each piece of information that makes up a cake (the flavor, etc) is called a @vocab{field}.  A field has both a descriptive name (like @code{flavor}) and a datatype.
				   
                                   @activity{What name describes the first field in a CakeType? What data type can we use to represent it?}
				   
                                   There is a little bit of new syntax involved in defining structures. On the first line on @worksheet-link[#:name "Cakes"], we write @code{flavor :: String,}, which tells Pyret that the first element of @italic{any} CakeType will be its flavor, represented by a String. This line shows how to define one field in a data structure.
				   
                                   @activity{What name describes the second field in a CakeType? What data type can we use to represent it?}
				   
                                   On the next line, write @code{layers :: Number,}, which tells Pyret that the second element of any CakeType will be its number of layers, represented by a Number.
				   
                                   @activity{What data structure should we use to represent whether or not the CakeType is an ice cream cake?  Use this to define another field.}
				   
                                   On your paper, you should have: 
                                   @code[#:multi-line #t]{ # a CakeType is a flavor, number of layers, 
                                                           # and whether or not it is an ice cream cake.
                                                       data CakeType:
                                                         | cake(
                                                             flavor      :: String,
                                                             layers      :: Number, 
                                                             is-iceCream :: Boolean)
                                                       end}
                             This is the code that defines the CakeType data structure. It tells the computer what a CakeType is and what goes into it. It also defines its @vocab{constructor} function, called @code{cake}. To make a CakeType, you @italic{must} call the constructor function with three things: a @code{flavor}, which is a String, @code{layers}, a Number, and @code{is-iceCream}, which is a Boolean. Remember that order matters! For now, these are the only things that we're going to keep track of in a CakeType, but you can imagine how you might extend it to include other information.}

				 a concrete cake with specific values for each field. In programming, we create instances much more often than we create new data structures.
				 For now, the important point is to recognize the difference between a structure @italic{definition} (the @code{data....} piece of code) and
				 specific @vocab{instances} of a data structure (like @code{birthday-cake}, or @code{jumper(44, 75)}.

				     cake?" and produce an answer.  If all they have is the CakeType definition, they can't answer such questions. Some people like the analogy of a cookie cutter here -- CakeType defines
				     a cookie cutter, but doesn't produce any cookies.  To get a cookie, you use the @code{cake} constructor to define a specific cake with specific values for the fields.}}

                                  Booleans? If we don't do anything to our input, or use any function on it, we get back exactly what we put in! Here, you put in a CakeType, let's see what we get back.  At first glance, it looks like a function call was the answer!  But there's a few things different about what appears in the output.  First, it isn't the same color as a normal function call, which is the first hint that something's different.  Second, we can @emph{click} on it, and see that this value is storing three other values in its @vocab{fields} – the flavor, layers, and whether or not it's ice cream.  This compound value that's printed is an @vocab{instance} of a @code{CakeType}.
