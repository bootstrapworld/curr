        @points[@point{@student{@animated-gif{images/pong.gif}In Unit 3, you practiced decomposing simple animations into their data structures and functions. Let's consider how a 
                               2-player game of Pong works: There are two "players", each represented by a paddle on either side of the screen. Each paddle
                               can move up and down, as long as they remain on the screen. There is also a ping-pong ball, which moves at any angle and can 
                               be on or off the screen. Let's start out by adding the paddles, making sure they can move up and down, and then we'll add the ball 
                               later. @activity{Using a blank Animation Design Worksheet, figure out how the paddles behave throughout the game,
                                                and decide what Data Structure you'll need to represent those behaviors.}

                       }
                 @point{@student{Here is one possible structure that we could use to model the two players:
                                @code[#:multi-line #t]{

# of paddle1 and paddle2

                                We can imagine a few sample @code{pongState} instances, in which the paddles are at different locations on the screen. If you 
                                haven't already, it would be a good idea to define a sample state for when the game starts, and maybe two other states
                                where the paddles are at other locations.}

                                up these functions to the @code{on-key} and @code{to-draw} event handlers.

                                When you run this reactor with @code{interact(pong-react)}, you should see your initial instance drawn on the screen,
                                and the paddle positions should change based on the keys you press! Do all four keys do what you expect

                                 The ball starts out moving up and to the right, but once it hits a wall the direction needs to change.
                                 Instead of moving up (adding 10 each tick), it's now moving down (adding -10 each tick) after
                                 bouncing off the wall (it's still moving up the screen by 10 each time, so we leave that unchanged).
                                 @bold{Note:} Once the ball hits the wall, its y-position needs to change! If the ball stays where it is,
                                 it will still be considered to have "hit" the wall on the next @code{tick}. This will cause the ball to jitter
                                 back and forth, as it constantly hits the same wall over and over.

                                           previous position and the @code{move} fields. Then, add conditionals to @code{next-state-tick}

                 @point{@student{Let's walk through our new @code{next-state-tick function}, and make sure we understand it:
                                 @code[#:multi-line #t]{
# next-state-tick : pongState -> pongState
# move the ball, based on direction fields
fun next-state-tick(w):
  if (is-on-wall(w)):
    pong(
      w.paddle1Y,               
      w.paddle2Y,
      # the paddles don't change position
      w.ballX + w.moveX,        
      # the ball keeps moving in the same x-direction
      w.ballY + (w.moveY * -1), 
      # but it bounces off the wall (move backwards by moveY)
      w.moveX,            
      # the x-direction stays the same
      w.moveY * -1)
      # and the y-direction is reversed
  else:
    pong(
      w.paddle1Y,
      w.paddle2Y,
      w.ballX + w.moveX,
      w.ballY + w.moveY,
      w.moveX,
      w.moveY)
  end
end
}
                                 If a collision with an upper or lower wall occurs, we need to do two things. First, we need to move the ball to it's next position,
                                 and make sure that new position is far enough away from the paddle so that it won't be considered another
                                 collision. Second, we need to flip the y-direction so that the ball is moving in the opposite direction.
                                 This is easy to do, by multiplying the @code{moveY} by -1.
