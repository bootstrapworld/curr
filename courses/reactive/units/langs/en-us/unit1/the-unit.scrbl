        @points[@point{@student{Welcome back to Bootstrap! In Bootstrap:Algebra, you used a @vocab{programming language} called Racket to make your video games. We chose this language because it behaves like algebra, but there are many different languages you could use to make video games. In Bootstrap:Reactive, you’re going to learn a new language, called Pyret. Pyret has many of the features of Racket, but with a different @vocab{syntax} that looks more like popular languages such as Python. This unit will help you make the switch to Pyret syntax in no time!}
                       @teacher{@bold{Why the language switch?}
                                 
                                 Some students and teachers may already have experiences with languages such as HTML, JavaScript, or Python.  With each new language, one encounters new syntax (how the language looks) and semantics (how the language behaves). Each of these languages has settings for which it is particularly appropriate and effective, and learning each teaches new lessons about programming style. The world of computing is multi-lingual, and we think a good introduction to computing should be, too.
                                 
                                 @bold{Why Pyret?} 
                                 
                                 Pyret, the language we will learn in Bootstrap:Reactive, takes all the nice parts of the Bootstrap:Algebra language, and uses a syntax that is similar to traditional industry languages like Python. This means it shares the mathematical behavior of Racket, and allows for easy image-manipulation, test-cases, and the Design Recipe. This lets teachers and students to use what they know about Racket as they progress into Bootstrap:Reactive. Pyret also has some unique features that make programming interactive programs more pleasant than in WeScheme.

                                 
This new syntax gives us an opportunity to show students that key programming ideas, like defining and using functions, carry over across different languages. It also provides a stepping stone towards more traditional languages, without diving head first into a language like Python, in which we'd have to learn different rules for numbers (among other things), new terminology for errors, and use functions that don’t always correspond to algebra. Pyret also provides us with the ability to write interactive programs and use images in a familiar way.}}
                 
                 @point{@student{Open your workbook to @worksheet-link[#:name "Review"]. Here we have a table, with examples of value definitions in Racket and Pyret. On the left-hand column, we've defined values in Racket, and on the right we have the same values defined in Pyret. For instance, the first line on the left-hand side says @code{(define AGE 14)}. Directly to the right, we have the Pyret @vocab{syntax}: @code{AGE = 14}, which does the same thing: defines a variable called AGE, which has a value of 14.

The definitions area (where you write code you want to save for later) is on the left side of the screen, and the interactions area (where you write code you just want to test out once, like scratch paper) is on the right. The top of the editor has space to write a name for your program, and the "Run" button at the top right will clear the interactions area and run whatever program is written in the definitions area.}

               @point{@student{One of the big changes from Racket to Pyret is the way arithmetic functions are used.

               @point{@student{Another difference between Racket and Pyret is that Pyret requires commas between each input to a function.

@itemlist[@item{The @vocab{Name} of the function: in this case, @code{star}.}
                    @item{The @vocab{Domain} of a function, which is the type(s) of data that the function expects. In this case, a Number and two Strings.}

A contract is a note we write to ourselves about how to use the function. Just as in Bootstrap:Algebra, it will be helpful to keep track of the contracts for each function you learn about. The last page in your workbook has a table labeled "Contracts," where you can (and should!) copy down each contract as you learn it.
Contracts in Pyret are just as important as they are in Racket, and are written the same way. You write contracts as comments: pieces of text for humans only, which are ignored by the computer. In Racket we used a @code{;} (semicolon) before Contracts, but in Pyret, just put a @code{#} (pound sign, or octothorpe) before a line of text to turn it into a comment!

Be sure to use vocabulary - Contract, Domain, Range, Example, etc. - regularly and carefully, pushing students to use the proper terms throughout. The Design Recipe is a useful tool for having students think about word problems and break them down into smaller parts (Contract, purpose statement, examples, and code). Instead of jumping into writing a function, students should first note what data types the function will take in and produce, and practice using their own words to describe what the function does. After this step, the Contract and Purpose Statement can be relied on to write examples for the function.}}
                   
                  @point{@student{@bannerline{Step 2: Give Examples}
                                   In Bootstrap:Algebra you wrote EXAMPLES for every function, to show how the function could be used with some inputs. Those examples also worked to test your function, and would give you error messages if the expected result didn’t match the result produced by the function body. Pyret has the same thing, but written differently. Here are our examples for the function @code{double}:
@code[#:multi-line #t]{examples:
                             double(5) is 2 * 5
                             double(7) is 2 * 7
                       end}
The key words here are @italic{examples} and @italic{is}. Pyret knows that anything within the @code{examples:} and @code{end} lines are your examples, and just like in Racket, we start with the name of the function and some input(s), followed by the code we expect to get back. This time, we have the word @code{is} between them, to say:
...@italic{test}... is equivalent to ...@italic{result}...
Once you’ve defined the function itself, Pyret will automatically check your examples to make sure your results match the function body. If they don’t, you’ll get an error message, just like in Bootstrap:Algebra.}
                          @teacher{Make sure students are writing Pyret code for the results of their examples. @code{double(5) is 10}, while technically correct, doesn’t show us the work and thought process behind the code, and makes it much harder to define the function in the next step. Writing examples is akin to "showing your work" in math class: You want to see @italic{how} students arrived at their answers, not just that they have an answer. It is also much easier to debug a function using the design recipe, because you can check each section individually for errors. Writing examples for code is also called "unit testing," something professional programmers do all the time.}}
                  
                  @point{@student{@activity[#:forevidence (list "BS-DR.1&1&1" "BS-DR.2&1&1")]{At the bottom of @worksheet-link[#:name "Fast-Functions-double"] in your workbook, write the contract and two examples for a function called @code{triple}, which takes in a number as its input and multiplies it by 3.}
                                    Now look at your two examples. What is the only thing that changes from one to the other? @activity{In your workbook, circle what is changeable, or @vocab{variable}, between your two examples.} 
               The only thing that changes is the Number being given to @code{triple} and multiplied by 3. Remember from Bootstrap:Algebra that once you've circled and labeled what changes in each example, it becomes incredibly easy to define the function! All you need to do is replace the thing that changes with its label! 
               @bannerline{Step 3: Define the function}
                @code[#:multi-line #t]{fun double(n):
                                          2 * n
                                      end}
               Like writing examples, defining the function is just a bit different in Pyret. To start, we write the word @code{fun} instead of @code{define}. Then it’s just like you remember from Bootstrap:Algebra. Copy everything from your @code{examples} that doesn’t change (except for the word @code{is}!), and replace the changeable thing with the variable you picked. Don’t forget a colon ( : ) after your function header, and the word @code{end} at the end of the function body, to let the computer know you’re finished defining that function!
               @activity[#:forevidence (list "8.F.1-3&1&1")]{Now write the function header and body for @code{triple}. Don't forget to replace the changing thing with a variable!}}
            @teacher{Just as writing a Contract helps us write examples, writing examples makes it easier to write the function definition: circling what changes between the examples makes it obvious that the @italic{changeable} thing is where we need to use a @italic{variable} in our function. You will want to explicitly connect each step in the Design Recipe to every other step. Ask students to justify each part of their Contract by referring back to the Word Problem, to justify each step of their examples by referring back to their Contract, and to justify each step of the definition by referring to their Contract and Examples. The same variable name can be used in multiple functions, just as in math (where many functions use x as the variable name, for example).
                     This activity can be done as a team competition: teams have one minute to write the contract and two examples for @code{triple}, and another minute for the function header and body. Assign points to the teams that complete each function. Make sure students fill out the ENTIRE contract, with two examples, before they circle what changes and move on to the function body. Build these good habits early in the course!}}

In Bootstrap:Algebra, the way your game characters moved and where they were placed on the screen was mostly determined for you. In this course, you have all the control over your animation. To start, let's practice making static scenes: images with no animation. Do you remember the @code{put-image} function from Racket? Pyret has the same function, and its contract should look familiar:  @code[#:multi-line #t]{# put-image : Image, Number, Number, Image -> Image}.

                               This piece of code uses the @code{put-image} function to place the image of the boat onto the @code{BACKGROUND} at the coordinates 750, 200. To find out the best place to put the image of the boat, first we had to find out how large the background image was. Two functions help with this:  @code[#:multi-line #t]{# image-width :: Image -> Number} which returns the width of the given image (in pixels), and   @code[#:multi-line #t]{# image-height :: Image -> Number} which returns the height of the given image.
