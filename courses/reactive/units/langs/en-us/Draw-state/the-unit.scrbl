         @point{@student{Accordingto the @code{next-state-tick} function, on every clock tick the state (a single number) will increase by one, which is exactly what happens. Since we didn't tell the reactor how to draw the state (the @code{to-draw} part of the reactor is commented out), when the reactor runs we see the state of the reactor (a single number) increasing, instead of an animation. @activity{What do you think would happen if we had a reactor with a complete @code{draw-state} function, but a @code{next-state-tick} function that never updated the state? (Consuming and producing the same value.)}}
                 @teacher{Reinforce the fact that, although the @code{draw-state} and @code{next-state-tick} functions work together within a reactor to produce an animation, each function can work without the other. In this example, @code{next-state-tick} will update the state even without a function to draw the state.}}

         @point{@student{There are much more interesting things we can display using a number as the state of the reactor, however! @activity{Change the @code{draw-state} function so that it consumes a Number and produces an image. Then, uncomment the @code{to-draw: draw-state} line in the reactor to see an animation when the program runs!}}
