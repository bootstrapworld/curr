Finding the distance in one dimesion is pretty easy: if the characters are on the same number line, we subtract the @italic{smaller} coordinate from
the @italic{larger} one, and we have our distance.

                                 this out can also work well: draw a number line, have two students stand at different points on the

                                 any bigger or smaller. Likewise, the white space has been broken into two smaller squares, but in total it 
                                 remains the same size. By using the side-lengths A and B, one can calculate the area of the two squares.

We could choose a number and always place it at the same y-coordinate each time, but then the game would be really easy! To make it more challenging, we'd like the dog to appear at a @italic{random} y-coordinate each time it collides with the cat. Thankfully, Pyret has a function which produces a random number between zero and its input: @code{# num-random :: Number -> Number}}
