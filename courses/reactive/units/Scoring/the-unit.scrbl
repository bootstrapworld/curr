                                since you've learned enough to program your entire Bootstrap:Algebra game (and more) yourself! In this

                                 the most requested features in these lessons. Because each students' game will be different, we've 
                                 used a Pyret version of the original Ninja Cat game as an example program, but the lesson can be 
                                 adapted to add scoring to any game.}}

                 @point{@student{The score is something that will be changing in the game, so you can be sure that it has to be added
                                 to the @code{____State} data structure. In our example Ninja Cat program, we've called our structure 
                                 @code{GameState}, which currently contains the x and y-coordinates for our player, danger, and target, 
                                 plus the speed of the danger, and speed of the target. Your game(s) will likely have different structures.

                               Remember: Since your structure is changing, you now have to go through your game code---@italic{every time}
                               you call the constructor function for your structure (ours is @code{game()}), the score must be included. 
                               It may be helpful to add the score as the very first or last field of the structure, to make this easier.

   The @code{GameState} structure for @editor-link[#:public-id "0B9rKDmABYlJVVkpkTmEyd1ZTaE0" "our Ninja Cat game"] now looks like this:
      @code[#:multi-line #t]{data GameState:

      targetspeed :: Number,
      score :: Number)
end

                                   This lesson is @bold{not} meant to be followed exactly, but rather used to give students an idea of what 
                                   steps they should take to add a scoring system to their own games. For extra practice, students 
                                   can work through adding a scoring system to the Ninja Cat program as well as their own games.}}

                 @point{@student{Now that the game has a score, that score needs to actually increase or decrease depending on what happens in the game. For our Ninja Cat game, we'll say that the score should go up by 30 points when Ninja Cat collides with the ruby (target), and down by 20 points when she collides with the dog (danger).

That will be the first condition inside @code{next-state-tick}, since we don't want the game to continue if it's already over! (In our Ninja Cat game, @code{game-over} returns true if the cat collides with the dog, AND the cat is on the ground.) After checking whether or not the game is over, the next three conditions in our @code{next-state-tick} function check whether the player has collided with the danger and target, as well as whether the player is jumping on the danger:

@code[#:multi-line #t]{# next-state-tick : GameState -> GameState
fun next-state-tick(g):
  if game-over(g): g
  # if player and danger collide while player is on the ground, 
  #reset player and danger and decrease score

      g.score - 20)
    # if player and danger collide while player is jumping, 
    # reset danger and increase score
  else if is-collision(g.playerx, g.playery, g.dangerx, g.dangery) 
    and (g.playery > 110) and (g.playery < 300):

                                       game's scoring system isn't a seprate score at all, but a timer that increases every tick, and

In the @code{draw-state} function, images are placed onto the background using @code{put-image} to draw the game. But the score is 
represented by a Number: we need a way to represent it as an Image. Thankfully, Pyret has some built-in functions that can help with this: 
the function @code{num-to-string} takes in a Number for its domain and returns a String representation of that number. This string can 
then be passed to the @code{text} function to return an Image that can be used in @code{draw-state}.
