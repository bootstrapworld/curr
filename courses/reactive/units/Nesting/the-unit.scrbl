However, as you add more things to your game, you quickly end up with a large number of elements in your data structure. (If you have multiple characters in your game, each with their own position, speed, costume, etc. that all change, your structure can become quite long and unwieldy.)}

                        @point{@student{Making changes to your structure, or writing functions to alter it, can get extremely complex. One way to manage this complexity is to use @italic{nested} structures: Just like we can write functions to handle repetitive processes, we can make structures to handle repetitive data. For example, if each of our 4 game characters have their own x and y coordinates, we could make one @code{Position} structure to use for each character. Then, instead of our game structure containing 8 numbers, it only contains 4 @code{Position}s.}
                                @teacher{}}
                                
                                @point{@student{Let's start out with a small animation to explore the benefits of nested structures. Open the @editor-link[#:public-id "0B9rKDmABYlJVMjF3OU83dGtaVTQ&v=a49eb01" "Pinwheels Starter #1"] file in Pyret, and click "Run". We see four colorful pinwheels spinning in the breeze. Now, take a look at the code:

@code[#:multi-line #t]{# A PinwheelState is the angle of rotation for 4 pinwheels
data PinwheelState:
  | pinwheel(
      p1a :: Number,
      p2a :: Number,
      p3a :: Number,
      p4a :: Number)
end

STARTING-PINWHEELS = pinwheel(60, 3, 25, 70)}

The only things that change in this animation are the angles of rotaton for each of the 4 pinwheels, and each of those numbers are included in the @code{PinwheelState} data structure. As usual, we have a @code{next-state-tick} function to handle updating the state of the animation, and a @code{draw-state} function to draw the animation. We also have two @vocab{helper functions} to do some of the work for these main functions: @code{update-pinwheel}, which increases the angle for an individual pinwheel, and @code{draw-pinwheel}, which rotates the pinwheel image by the given angle. We'll talk about @vocab{helper functions} in greater detail later, but for now, notice that because we've delegated most of the heavy lifting to these helpers, our @code{next-state-tick} function @italic{only} needs to make a new @code{PinwheelState} by calling on @code{update-pinwheel} to increase the angle of rotation for each number in the structure. Most of the actual work in this function is done by @code{update-pinwheel}.} 
                        @teacher{}}
                 
                 @point{@student{Suppose we wanted each of the pinwheels to spin at a different speed.

                 @point{@student{Now we have a nice animation of pinwheels spinning at different speeds, but what if we had started off by making each individual pinwheel @italic{its own structure}?

The animation still works and looks the same on the outside, and the code hasn't changed @italic{too} drastically.}

                                 @teacher{Point out the differences in underlining between the two code screenshots. Note that when students finish this activity, both of the animations will look the same- but one program will have been much more straightforward to modify! We wrote a bit more code at the beginning to set up the nested structures, but that paid off later by giving us more flexibility to change the behavior of the pinwheels.}}

                    @bannerline{@bitmap{images/Nesting1.png}}  
                                    
                 
                 Just by looking at the differences on paper, we can see the difference in complexity of changing our animations. In order to make each pinwheel spin at a different speed, much more of the non-nested program will need to change, as opposed to the nested version where only the @code{Pinwheel} structure, @code{STARTING-PINWHEELS} instance, and the @code{update-pinwheel} function need to be edited.}
                            @teacher{}}
                    
                    @point{@student{What if we wanted to add a breeze to our animation, and make the pinwheels move across the screen to the left? Let's assume that each pinwheel moves at the same speed, but each of their x-coordinates will need to change. @activity{Go through the same process as before: Starting with the non-nested version of the code, print out these code screenshots: @itemlist[@item{@(hyperlink "http://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/spring2017/courses/reactive/resources/images/NonNested-Pinwheels2.png" "Non-nested pinwheels")}

Do this for both the nested and non-nested versions of the animation.}}
                          @teacher{@bold{Optonal:} For practice, have students make this change in both programs on the computer. Have them pay special attention to their helper functions- will they be able to use the existing @code{update-pinwheel} in the non-nested version of the animation?}}
          @point{@student{
                   @bannerline{@bitmap{images/Nesting2.png}} 
                                     
                                     
                          As before, we end up underlining, and needing to change @italic{much} more of the code in the non-nested version of the animation. We also may realize something important about the non-nested code: if both a pinwheel's angle of rotation @italic{and} its x-coordinate are changing, we're no longer able to use our @code{update-pinwheel} @vocab{helper function}. Previously, this function consumed an angle and speed, and added these numbers together to produce the new angle. However, since functions can only return one thing at a time, we can't use this function to produce the updated angle and updated x-coordinate. Instead, the work of decreasing the x-coordinate must be done inside @code{next-state-tick}. Writing that code is nothing new, but wouldn't it be nice to leave @code{next-state-tick} alone, and update each pinwheel individually inside the @vocab{helper function}?}
                            @teacher{For reference, the complete code for the nested and non-nested versions of the pinwheels file including speed can be found here: @itemlist[@item{@editor-link[#:public-id "0B9rKDmABYlJVWWM2aTdUZG02ZGM&v=a49eb01" "Non-nested Pinwheels+Speed"]}

                    @point{@student{Compare the updating functions for the non-nested version of the code:
          @code[#:multi-line #t]{
# update-pinwheel : Number, Number -> Number
fun update-pinwheel(angle, speed):
  angle + speed
end

# next-state-tick : PinwheelState -> PinwheelState
fun next-state-tick(ps):
  pinwheel(
    update-pinwheel(ps.p1a, ps.p1speed),
    ps.p1speed,
    ps.p1x - 5,
    update-pinwheel(ps.p2a, ps.p2speed),
    ps.p2speed,
    ps.p2x - 5,
    update-pinwheel(ps.p3a, ps.p3speed),
    ps.p3speed,
    ps.p3x - 5,
    update-pinwheel(ps.p4a, ps.p4speed),
    ps.p4speed, 
    ps.p4x - 5)
end      }
          
          And the nested version:  @code[#:multi-line #t]{
# update-pinwheel : Pinwheel -> Pinwheel
fun update-pinwheel(p):
  pw(p.angle + p.speed, p.speed, p.x - 5)
end

# next-state-tick : PinwheelState -> PinwheelState
fun next-state-tick(ps):
  pinwheels(
    update-pinwheel(ps.p1),
    update-pinwheel(ps.p2),
    update-pinwheel(ps.p3),
    update-pinwheel(ps.p4))
end   }
          
          Not only is the version which uses nested structures @italic{much} shorter, it's also much more readable. Using a nested structure affords us a unique opportunity for abstraction- If each pinwheel moves the same way, we can use one @vocab{helper function} on all of them, each time consuming a pinwheel and producing the updated pinwheel. This way the only function that needs to change is the one which addresses the "child" strucure (in this case, @code{update-pinwheel}, which consumes a@code{Pinwheel}), and the function @code{next-state-tick}, which consumes the "parent" structure @code{PinwheelState}, can stay unchanged. This offers you lots more flexibility when making changes to your code, or adding things to a program.}
