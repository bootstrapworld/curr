     @point{@student{Right now, each character in your game moves along only
     one axis. @code{update-danger} takes in the danger's coordinates and
     produces the next one, but it has no ability to update the y-coordinate.
     As a result, the danger can only move left or right.

                     @code[#:multi-line #t]{update-danger :: Number, Number -> Number
                                            # takes in object's coordinates and returns the next x coordinate}

             @teacher{Use a diagram on the board to demonstrate that @code{update-danger} will need to take in both the x- and the y-coordinate, and that it will have to produce both as well.}}
      @point{@student{While you've seen a function take in multiple values, you have never seen a function @italic{produce} more than one thing at a time.
                       @bannerline{All functions must produce one value.}}
              @teacher{}
              }
      @point{@student{However, Pyret actually allows us to create new kinds of
      data that can contain more than one thing. These are called @vocab["data structures"],
      or "structs" for short. One kind of struct that is useful to
      us is called a position, which Pyret abbreviates @code{posn}.

                     @activity{Open @hyperlink["https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=16MQzrj2WbZQwb1uSpGN3n0svws8eK8R8&v=f9e4ffe" "the posn starter file"] and click "Run"

                                          @item{Enter a Boolean value in the Interactions window and hit Enter. What did you get back?}]
                               As you can see, all values evaluate to @italic{themselves}. To create a @code{posn}, enter the following code in the Interactions window: 
                               @code[#:multi-line #t]{posn(10, 40)}
                               What do you get back when you hit Enter? Which number is the x-coordinate? The y-coordinate?

              @teacher{Have students make @code{Posn}s for other coordinates, like the corners of the screen or the center.}
              }
      @point{@student{Thinking back to an @code{update-danger} that moves diagonally, we now know that the @vocab{Range} must be a @code{posn}.

                      @activity{Start with a blank design recipe worksheet, and
                      rewrite @code{update-danger} to produce a Posn instead of
                      a Number. Instead of producing @code{(x - 10)}, your
                      function will have to produce a Posn in which the x and y
                      have changed in some way. Here's one example, which moves
                      the danger left by 10 pixels and down by 5

                               @code[#:multi-line #t]{

                               end
