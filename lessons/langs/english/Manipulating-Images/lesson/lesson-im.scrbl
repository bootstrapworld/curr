          @point{@student{Earlier, you learned how to create simple images using operators such as @code{circle}, @code{rectangle}, and @code{triangle}.  We can combine or manipulate these basic shapes to make more interesting ones, the same way we can combine and manipulate numbers.  In this lesson, you'll learn Racket functions for manipulating and combining images.}
                 @teacher{Use of the board is critical in this activity - you'll want to have lots of room to write, and lots of visuals for students to see. Have students review some of the Image-producing functions they already know (@code{triangle}, @code{circle}, etc.). Quiz them on the contracts for these functions.}
                 }
           @point{@student{@bitmap{images/simple-spaceship.png}Imagine that we wanted to make an image of a simple satellite that looks like the one shown here. This image contains a blue circle and a red rectangle, with the circle on top of the rectangle.  Racket has a function called @code{overlay}, which lets you put one image on top of another. Here is its contract, and a purpose statement that explains what it does:
                            @code[#:multi-line ""]{; overlay : Image Image -> Image
                                                   ; Draws the first image on top of the second image}}
                   @teacher{Start out by reminding students why contracts matter: they specify @italic{types} instead of @italic{values}, which makes them really flexible! You can demonstrate this by showing them the code for a simple  image, and then replacing the size of the triangle with a sub-expression:
                            @code[#:multi-line ""]{; simple image expression
                                  (star 50
                                  "solid"
                                  "red")
                                  ; with a sub-expression
                                  (star (* 10 10)
                                  "solid"
                                  "red")}
                            This sets students up to see @code{overlay} as a logical extension - instead of image-producing Circles of Evaluation with number-producing subexpressions, there can be image-producing Circles with @italic{image-producing} subexpressions.}
                   }
           @point{@student{Using @code{overlay}, we could make a picture of a satellite. Take a look at the code below, then hit "enter" and see what shape it makes! Can you change the color of the circle? The size of the rectangle? Can you use @code{overlay} to put a star on top of both the star @italic{and} the rectangle?

           @point{@student{@bitmap{images/rotated-spaceship.png}This satellite is flying level in the sky.  What if a strong wind were blowing, causing the satellite to fly slightly on its side, like the image seen here? Then, we would want the Racket @code{rotate} function:
@code[#:multi-line #t]{
(rotate 30
        (overlay (circle 10 "solid" "blue")
                 (rectangle 30 8 "solid" "red")))
}
            Try copying and pasting this code into the editor, and see what shape you get. What happens if you change the number @code{30}?}
                   @teacher{Have the class convert this code into a Circle of Evaluation.}}
                              
           @point{@student{@bitmap{images/circles-with-images.png}Let's look at this code, viewed as a Circle of Evaluation. Our @code{rotate} function is shown here, in the blue circle. @code{30} is the number of degrees we'll be rotating, and the second input is the @code{Image} we want to rotate. That image is @italic{the result of overlaying the circle and the rectangle}, shown here in red. By looking at this Circle of Evaluation, can you guess the contract for the @code{rotate} function?}
                   @teacher{Can students write the code or draw the Circle of Evaluation for rotating a difference shape by a different amount? Try using a subexpression like @code{(* 2 75)} for the rotation, instead of a simple number.}}
                              
           @point{@student{Here are the contract and purpose for rotate:
                           @code[#:multi-line ""]{; rotate : Number Image -> Image
                                                  ; Rotates the image by the given number of degrees}}
                   @teacher{When it's time to introduce the new functions, start out by showing them the contract and then an example, as it does in the student guide. Make sure to ask lots of "how do you know?" questions during the code, to remind them that the contract has all the necessary information.}}
                              
           @point{@student{Suppose you wanted to make the satellite bigger, by scaling it up to 2x or 3x it's original size. Racket has a function that will do just that, called @code{scale}. Here is the contract and purpose statement for scale:
                           @code[#:multi-line ""]{; scale : Number Image -> Image
                                                  ; Reproduce the given image with both dimensions multiplied
                                                  ;     by the given number}
          Below is some code that will scale a star to make it one-half the original size. What would you change to make it bigger instead of smaller? What would you need to change to scale a different-color star? What if you wanted to scale a circle instead? @italic{Can you figure out how to scale the entire spaceship}?
          
           @editor-link[#:interactions-text "(scale 0.5 (star 50 \"solid\" \"purple\"))"

           @point{@student{There are also functions for flipping an image horizontally or vertically, and for scaling images so they get bigger or smaller.  Here are contracts and purpose statements for those functions:
                           @code[#:multi-line ""]{; flip-horizontal : Image -> Image
                                                  ; Flip the given image on the horizontal (x) axis
                                                  
                                                  ; flip-vertical : Image -> Image
                                                  ; Flip the given image on the vertical (y) axis
                                                  
                                                  ; scale/xy : Number Number Image -> Image
                                                  ; Reproduce the given image with the horizontal (x)
                                                  ; dimension multiplied by the first number and the vertical
                                                  ; (y) dimension multiplied by the second number}}
                   @teacher{After a few of these, try mixing it up! Show students the Racket code or Circle of Evaluation for some of the new functions @italic{first}, and have them guess the contract based on how they is used.}}
