           @item{Words like "cat" are called Strings. A String is anything in quotation marks. 5 is not the same as "5"! The first is a number, and the second is a string.}

           @item{To create a Number in Racket, we just typed it in. To create a String, you type in the word or words that you want, and put quotation marks on either side.
